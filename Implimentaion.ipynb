      "RICH DAD POOR DAD\n",
      "Having two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points of\n",
      "view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man.\n",
      "I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated\n",
      "and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate\n",
      "work in less than two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the\n",
      "University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced\n",
      "studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the\n",
      "eighth grade.\n",
      "Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives.\n",
      "Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled financially. The\n",
      "other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving\n",
      "tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and his church. The other\n",
      "left bills to be paid.\n",
      "Both men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men offered\n",
      "me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed\n",
      "strongly in education but did not recommend the same course of study.\n",
      "If I had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice.\n",
      "Having two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points of view: one of\n",
      "a rich man and one of a poor man.\n",
      "Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself\n",
      "thinking more, comparing, and then choosing for myself. The problem was\n",
      "that the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man was not yet poor. Both\n",
      "were just starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money\n",
      "and families. But they had very different points of view about money.\n",
      "For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root of all\n",
      "evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”\n",
      "As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was\n",
      "difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not\n",
      "say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, particularly about\n",
      "money, was so extreme that I grew curious and intrigued. I began to start\n",
      "thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying.\n",
      "Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions\n",
      "such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same question of the\n",
      "other dad’s statement. It would have been much easier to simply say, “Yeah,\n",
      "he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply reject the point of view by\n",
      "saying, “The old man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Instead,\n",
      "having two dads whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a\n",
      "way of thinking for myself. As a process, choosing for myself turned out to\n",
      "be much more valuable in the long run than simply accepting or rejecting a\n",
      "single point of view.\n",
      "One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the\n",
      "middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home,\n",
      "not in school. Most of us learn about money from our parents. So what can\n",
      "poor parents tell their child about money? They simply say, “Stay in school\n",
      "and study hard.” The child may graduate with excellent grades, but with a\n",
      "poor person’s financial programming and mindset.\n",
      "Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and\n",
      "professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how smart\n",
      "bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades may struggle\n",
      "financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due in large part\n",
      "to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial\n",
      "decisions with little or no training in the subject of money.\n",
      "Today I often wonder what will soon happen when we have millions of\n",
      "people who need financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent\n",
      "upon their families or the government for financial support. What will\n",
      "happen when Medicare and Social Security run out of money? How will a\n",
      "nation survive if teaching children about money continues to be left to\n",
      "parents—most of whom will be, or already are, poor?\n",
      "Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had\n",
      "to think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight\n",
      "into the power and effect of one’s thoughts on one’s life. For example, one\n",
      "dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other dad forbade those\n",
      "words to be used. He insisted I ask, “How can I afford it?” One is a\n",
      "statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the\n",
      "other forces you to think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by\n",
      "automatically saying the words “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working.\n",
      "By asking the question “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. He\n",
      "did not mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical\n",
      "about exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. He’d\n",
      "say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger it\n",
      "gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that automatically saying “I\n",
      "can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.\n",
      "Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of\n",
      "putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the other had a habit\n",
      "of exercising his brain. The long-term result was that one dad grew stronger\n",
      "financially, and the other grew weaker. It is not much different from a\n",
      "person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone\n",
      "who sits on the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise\n",
      "increases your chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases\n",
      "your chances for wealth.\n",
      "My two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way they\n",
      "thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in taxes to take care\n",
      "of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes punish those who produce\n",
      "and reward those who don’t produce.”\n",
      "One dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to\n",
      "work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good\n",
      "company to buy.”\n",
      "One dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you kids.” The\n",
      "other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have you kids.”\n",
      "One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner table,\n",
      "while the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal.\n",
      "One said, “When it comes to money, play it safe. Don’t take risks.” The\n",
      "other said, “Learn to manage risk.”\n",
      "One believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our greatest\n",
      "asset.” The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your house is\n",
      "your largest investment, you’re in trouble.”\n",
      "Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the\n",
      "other paid his bills last.\n",
      "One dad believed in a company or the government taking care of you\n",
      "and your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises, retirement\n",
      "plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and other perks. He was\n",
      "impressed with two of his uncles who joined the military and earned a\n",
      "retirement-and-entitlement package for life after twenty years of active\n",
      "service. He loved the idea of medical benefits and PX privileges the\n",
      "military provided its retirees. He also loved the tenure system available\n",
      "through the university. The idea of job protection for life and job benefits\n",
      "seemed more important, at times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve\n",
      "worked hard for the government, and I’m entitled to these benefits.”\n",
      "The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against\n",
      "the entitlement mentality and how it created weak and financially needy\n",
      "people. He was emphatic about being financially competent.\n",
      "One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created investments.\n",
      "One dad taught me how to write an impressive resumé so I could find a\n",
      "good job. The other taught me how to write strong business and financial\n",
      "plans so I could create jobs.\n",
      "Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing\n",
      "the effects different thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed that people really\n",
      "do shape their lives through their thoughts.\n",
      "For example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And that\n",
      "prophecy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to\n",
      "himself as rich. He would say things like, “I’m a rich man, and rich people\n",
      "don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback,\n",
      "he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by\n",
      "saying, “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is\n",
      "temporary. Poor is eternal.”\n",
      "My poor dad would say, “I’m not interested in money,” or “Money\n",
      "doesn’t matter.” My rich dad always said, “Money is power.”\n",
      "The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it\n",
      "became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important to be aware of\n",
      "my thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor dad was\n",
      "poor, not because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant,\n",
      "but because of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy having two fathers,\n",
      "I became acutely aware of being careful about which thoughts I chose to\n",
      "adopt as my own. Should I listen to my rich dad or to my poor dad?\n",
      "There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke\n",
      "is temporary. Poor is eternal.\n",
      "Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning,\n",
      "they disagreed about what they thought was important to learn. One wanted\n",
      "me to study hard, earn a degree, and get a good job to earn money. He\n",
      "wanted me to study to become a professional, an attorney or an accountant,\n",
      "and to go to business school for my MBA. The other encouraged me to\n",
      "study to be rich, to understand how money works, and to learn how to have\n",
      "it work for me. “I don’t work for money!” were words he would repeat over\n",
      "and over. “Money works for me!”\n",
      "At the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad\n",
      "about money. In doing so, I chose not to listen to my poor dad, even though\n",
      "he was the one with all the college degrees.\n",
      "A Lesson from Robert Frost\n",
      "Robert Frost is my favorite poet. Although I love many of his poems, my\n",
      "favorite is “The Road Not Taken.” I use its lesson almost daily.\n",
      "The Road Not Taken\n",
      "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n",
      "And sorry I could not travel both\n",
      "And be one traveler, long I stood\n",
      "And looked down one as far as I could\n",
      "To where it bent in the undergrowth;\n",
      "Then took the other, as just as fair,\n",
      "And having perhaps the better claim,\n",
      "Because it was grassy and wanted wear\n",
      "Though as for that the passing there\n",
      "Had worn them really about the same,\n",
      "And both that morning equally lay\n",
      "In leaves no step had trodden black.\n",
      "Oh, I kept the first for another day!\n",
      "Yet knowing how way leads onto way,\n",
      "I doubted if I should ever come back.\n",
      "I shall be telling this with a sigh\n",
      "Somewhere ages and ages hence;\n",
      "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—\n",
      "I took the one less traveled by,\n",
      "And that has made all the difference.\n",
      "And that has made all the difference.\n",
      "Over the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost’s poem.\n",
      "Choosing not to listen to my highly educated dad’s advice and attitude\n",
      "about money was a painful decision, but it was a decision that shaped the\n",
      "rest of my life.\n",
      "Once I made up my mind about whom to listen to, my education about\n",
      "money began. My rich dad taught me over a period of 30 years until I was\n",
      "39 years old. He stopped once he realized that I knew and fully understood\n",

      "Because I was only nine years old when I started, the lessons my rich\n",
      "dad taught me were simple. And when it was all said and done, there were\n",
      "only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. This book is about those six\n",
      "lessons, put as simply as possible, just as simply as my rich dad put forth\n",
      "those lessons to me. The lessons are meant not to be answers, but\n",

      "LESSON 1: THE RICH DON’T WORK\n",
      "FOR MONEY\n",
      "The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have\n",
      "money work for them.\n",
      "“Dad, can you tell me how to get rich?”\n",
      "My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get rich,\n",
      "Son?”\n",
      "“Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and they\n",
      "were going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three of his\n",
      "friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They told us we weren’t invited\n",
      "because we were poor kids.”\n",
      "“They did?” my dad asked incredulously.\n",
      "“Yeah, they did,” I replied in a hurt tone.\n",
      "My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his\n",
      "nose, and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.\n",
      "The year was 1956. I was nine years old. By some twist of fate, I\n",
      "attended the same public school where the rich people sent their kids. We\n",
      "were primarily a sugar-plantation town. The managers of the plantation and\n",
      "the other affluent people, such as doctors, business owners, and bankers,\n",
      "sent their children to this elementary school. After grade six, their children\n",
      "were generally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one\n",
      "side of the street, I went to this school. Had I lived on the other side of the\n",
      "street, I would have gone to a different school with kids from families more\n",
      "like mine. After grade six, these kids and I would go on to the public\n",
      "intermediate and high school. There was no private school for them or for\n",
      "me.\n",
      "My dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking.\n",
      "“Well, Son…,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have to\n",
      "learn to make money.”\n",
      "“How do I make money?” I asked.\n",
      "“Well, use your head, Son,” he said, smiling. Even then I knew that\n",
      "really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell you,” or “I don’t know the\n",
      "answer, so don’t embarrass me.”\n",
      "A Partnership Is Formed\n",
      "The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had said.\n",
      "As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this school.\n",
      "Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had drawn a jog in\n",
      "the line for the school district, and we wound up in school with the rich\n",
      "kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we were because all the other\n",
      "boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, new everything.\n",
      "Mom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter, and\n",
      "clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, “If you want something,\n",
      "work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not much work available for\n",
      "nine-year-old boys.\n",
      "“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.\n",
      "“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”\n",
      "He agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my first\n",
      "business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas on how to\n",
      "make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool guys” at Jimmy’s\n",
      "beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt was good, because it\n",
      "inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make money. Finally, that\n",
      "afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an idea Mike got from a science\n",
      "book he had read. Excitedly, we shook hands, and the partnership now had\n",
      "a business.\n",
      "For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood,\n",
      "knocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their\n",
      "toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a\n",
      "smile. Some asked us what we were doing, to which we replied, “We can’t\n",
      "tell you. It’s a business secret.”\n",
      "My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a site\n",
      "next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our raw\n",
      "materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup bottles, our\n",
      "little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.\n",
      "Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’ messy,\n",
      "crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you boys\n",
      "doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to hear again that it’s a business\n",
      "secret. Do something with this mess, or I’m going to throw it out.”\n",
      "Mike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon have\n",
      "enough and then we would begin production. We informed her that we were\n",
      "waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish their toothpaste so we could have\n",
      "their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.\n",
      "The date to begin production was moved up, and the pressure was on.\n",
      "My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction notice by\n",
      "my own mom! It became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to quickly use up\n",
      "their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to brush more often\n",
      "anyway. I began to put together the production line.\n",
      "One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old boys in\n",
      "the driveway with a production line operating at full speed. There was fine\n",
      "white powder everywhere. On a long table were small milk cartons from\n",
      "school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing with red-hot coals at\n",
      "maximum heat.\n",
      "Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of the\n",
      "driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and his friend\n",
      "got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in which the\n",
      "toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days, toothpaste did not\n",
      "come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of lead. So once the paint was\n",
      "burned off, the tubes were dropped in the small steel pot. They melted until\n",
      "they became liquid, and with my mom’s pot holders, we poured the lead\n",
      "through a small hole in the top of the milk cartons.\n",
      "The milk cartons were filled with plaster of paris. White powder was\n",
      "everywhere. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the entire area\n",
      "looked like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk cartons were the outer\n",
      "containers for plaster of paris molds.\n",
      "My dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten lead\n",
      "through a small hole in the top of the plaster of paris cube.\n",
      "“Careful,” my dad said.\n",
      "I nodded without looking up.\n",
      "Finally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down and\n",
      "smiled at my dad.\n",
      "“What are you boys doing?” he asked with a cautious smile.\n",
      "“We’re doing what you told me to do. We’re going to be rich,” I said.\n",
      "“Yup,” said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. “We’re partners.”\n",
      "“And what is in those plaster molds?” my dad asked.\n",
      "“Watch,” I said. “This should be a good batch.”\n",
      "With a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube in half.\n",
      "Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a lead nickel fell\n",
      "out.\n",
      "“Oh, no!” my dad exclaimed. “You’re casting nickels out of lead!”\n",
      "“That’s right,” Mike said. “We’re doing as you told us to do. We’re\n",
      "making money.”\n",
      "My dad’s friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled and\n",
      "shook his head. Along with a fire and a box of spent toothpaste tubes, in\n",
      "front of him were two little boys covered with white dust smiling from ear\n",
      "to ear.\n",
      "He asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front step of\n",
      "our house. With a smile, he gently explained what the word “counterfeiting”\n",
      "meant.\n",
      "Our dreams were dashed. “You mean this is illegal?” asked Mike in a\n",
      "quivering voice.\n",
      "“Let them go,” my dad’s friend said. “They might be developing a\n",
      "natural talent.”\n",
      "My dad glared at him.\n",
      "“Yes, it is illegal,” my dad said gently. “But you boys have shown great\n",
      "creativity and original thought. Keep going. I’m really proud of you!”\n",
      "Disappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes before\n",
      "we began cleaning up our mess. The business was over on opening day.\n",
      "Sweeping the powder up, I looked at Mike and said, “I guess Jimmy and his\n",
      "friends are right. We are poor.”\n",
      "My father was just leaving as I said that. “Boys,” he said. “You’re only\n",
      "poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did something.\n",
      "Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. You’ve done something.\n",
      "I’m very proud of the two of you. I will say it again: Keep going. Don’t\n",
      "quit.”\n",
      "Mike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we still did\n",
      "not know what to do.\n",
      "“So how come you’re not rich, Dad?” I asked.\n",
      "“Because I chose to be a schoolteacher. Schoolteachers really don’t\n",
      "think about being rich. We just like to teach. I wish I could help you, but I\n",
      "really don’t know how to make money.”\n",
      "Mike and I turned and continued our cleanup.\n",
      "“I know,” said my dad. “If you boys want to learn how to be rich, don’t\n",
      "ask me. Talk to your dad, Mike.”\n",
      "“My dad?” asked Mike with a scrunched-up face.\n",
      "“Yeah, your dad,” repeated my dad with a smile. “Your dad and I have\n",
      "the same banker, and he raves about your father. He’s told me several times\n",
      "that your father is brilliant when it comes to making money.”\n",
      "“My dad?” Mike asked again in disbelief. “Then how come we don’t\n",
      "have a nice car and a nice house like the rich kids at school?”\n",
      "“A nice car and a nice house don’t necessarily mean you’re rich or you\n",
      "know how to make money,” my dad replied. “Jimmy’s dad works for the\n",
      "sugar plantation. He’s not much different from me. He works for a\n",
      "company, and I work for the government. The company buys the car for\n",
      "him. The sugar company is in financial trouble, and Jimmy’s dad may soon\n",
      "have nothing. Your dad is different, Mike. He seems to be building an\n",
      "empire, and I suspect in a few years he will be a very rich man.”\n",
      "With that, Mike and I got excited again. With new vigor, we began\n",
      "cleaning up the mess caused by our now-defunct first business. As we were\n",
      "cleaning, we made plans for how and when to talk to Mike’s dad. The\n",
      "problem was that Mike’s dad worked long hours and often did not come\n",
      "home until late. His father owned warehouses, a construction company, a\n",
      "chain of stores, and three restaurants. It was the restaurants that kept him\n",
      "out late.\n",
      "Mike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up. He was\n",
      "going to talk to his dad when he got home that night and ask him if he\n",
      "would teach us how to become rich. Mike promised to call as soon as he\n",
      "had talked to his dad, even if it was late.\n",
      "The phone rang at 8:30 p.m.\n",
      "“Okay,” I said. “Next Saturday.” I put the phone down. Mike’s dad had\n",
      "agreed to meet with us.\n",
      "On Saturday I caught the 7:30 a.m. bus to the poor side of town.\n",
      "The Lessons Begin\n",
      "Mike and I met with his dad that morning at eight o’clock. He was\n",
      "already busy, having been at work for more than an hour. His construction\n",
      "supervisor was just leaving in his pickup truck as I walked up to his simple,\n",
      "small, and tidy home. Mike met me at the door.\n",
      "“Dad’s on the phone, and he said to wait on the back porch,” Mike said\n",
      "as he opened the door.\n",
      "The old wooden floor creaked as I stepped across the threshold of the\n",
      "aging house. There was a cheap mat just inside the door. The mat was there\n",
      "to hide the years of wear from countless footsteps that the floor had\n",
      "supported. Although clean, it needed to be replaced.\n",
      "I felt claustrophobic as I entered the narrow living room that was filled\n",
      "with old musty overstuffed furniture that today would be collectors’ items.\n",
      "Sitting on the couch were two women, both a little older than my mom.\n",
      "Across from the women sat a man in workman’s clothes. He wore khaki\n",
      "slacks and a khaki shirt, neatly pressed but without starch, and polished\n",
      "work boots. He was about 10 years older than my dad. They smiled as Mike\n",
      "and I walked past them toward the back porch. I smiled back shyly.\n",
      "“Who are those people?” I asked.\n",
      "“Oh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses, and the\n",
      "women are the managers of the restaurants. And as you arrived, you saw the\n",
      "construction supervisor who is working on a road project about 50 miles\n",
      "from here. His other supervisor, who is building a track of houses, left\n",
      "before you got here.”\n",
      "“Does this go on all the time?” I asked.\n",
      "“Not always, but quite often,” said Mike, smiling as he pulled up a chair\n",
      "to sit down next to me.\n",
      "“I asked my dad if he would teach us to make money,” Mike said.\n",
      "“Oh, and what did he say to that?” I asked with cautious curiosity.\n",
      "“Well, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he\n",
      "would make us an offer.”\n",
      "“Oh,” I said, rocking my chair back against the wall. I sat there perched\n",
      "on two rear legs of the chair.\n",
      "Mike did the same thing.\n",
      "“Do you know what the offer is?” I asked.\n",
      "“No, but we’ll soon find out.”\n",
      "Suddenly, Mike’s dad burst through the rickety screen door and onto the\n",
      "porch. Mike and I jumped to our feet, not out of respect, but because we\n",
      "were startled.\n",
      "“Ready, boys?” he asked as he pulled up a chair to sit down with us.\n",
      "We nodded our heads as we pulled our chairs away from the wall to sit\n",
      "in front of him.\n",
      "He was a big man, about six feet tall and 200 pounds. My dad was\n",
      "taller, about the same weight, and five years older than Mike’s dad. They\n",
      "sort of looked alike, though not of the same ethnic makeup. Maybe their\n",
      "energy was similar.\n",
      "“Mike says you want to learn to make money? Is that correct, Robert?”\n",
      "I nodded my head quickly, but with a little trepidation. He had a lot of\n",
      "power behind his words and smile.\n",
      "“Okay, here’s my offer. I’ll teach you, but I won’t do it classroom-style.\n",
      "You work for me, I’ll teach you. You don’t work for me, I won’t teach you.\n",
      "I can teach you faster if you work, and I’m wasting my time if you just want\n",
      "to sit and listen like you do in school. That’s my offer. Take it or leave it.”\n",
      "“Ah, may I ask a question first?” I asked.\n",
      "“No. Take it or leave it. I’ve got too much work to do to waste my time.\n",
      "If you can’t make up your mind decisively, then you’ll never learn to make\n",
      "money anyway. Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to\n",
      "make quick decisions is an important skill. You have the opportunity that\n",
      "you asked for. School is beginning, or it’s over in 10 seconds,” Mike’s dad\n",
      "said with a teasing smile.\n",
      "“Take it,” I said.\n",
      "“Take it,” said Mike.\n",
      "“Good,” said Mike’s dad. “Mrs. Martin will be by in 10 minutes. After\n",
      "I’m through with her, you’ll ride with her to my superette and you can begin\n",
      "working. I’ll pay you 10 cents an hour, and you’ll work three hours every\n",
      "Saturday.”\n",
      "“But I have a softball game today,” I said.\n",
      "Mike’s dad lowered his voice to a stern tone. “Take it, or leave it,” he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "“I’ll take it,” I replied, choosing to work and learn instead of playing.\n",
      "Thirty Cents Later\n",
      "By 9:00 a.m. that day, Mike and I were working for Mrs. Martin. She\n",
      "was a kind and patient woman. She always said that Mike and I reminded\n",
      "her of her two grown sons. Although kind, she believed in hard work and\n",
      "kept us moving. We spent three hours taking canned goods off the shelves,\n",
      "brushing each can with a feather duster to get the dust off, and then re-\n",
      "stacking them neatly. It was excruciatingly boring work.\n",
      "Mike’s dad, whom I call my rich dad, owned nine of these little\n",
      "superettes, each with a large parking lot. They were the early version of the\n",
      "7-Eleven convenience stores, little neighborhood grocery stores where\n",
      "people bought items such as milk, bread, butter, and cigarettes. The problem\n",
      "was that this was Hawaii before air-conditioning was widely used, and the\n",
      "stores could not close their doors because of the heat. On two sides of the\n",
      "store, the doors had to be wide open to the road and parking lot. Every time\n",
      "a car drove by or pulled into the parking lot, dust would swirl and settle in\n",
      "the store. We knew we had a job as long as there was no air-conditioning.\n",
      "For three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked our\n",
      "three hours. By noon, our work was over, and she dropped three little dimes\n",
      "in each of our hands. Now, even at the age of nine in the mid-1950s, 30\n",
      "cents was not too exciting. Comic books cost 10 cents back then, so I\n",
      "usually spent my money on comic books and went home.\n",
      "By Wednesday of the fourth week, I was ready to quit. I had agreed to\n",
      "work only because I wanted to learn to make money from Mike’s dad, and\n",
      "now I was a slave for 10 cents an hour. On top of that, I had not seen Mike’s\n",
      "dad since that first Saturday.\n",
      "“I’m quitting,” I told Mike at lunchtime. School was boring, and now I\n",
      "did not even have my Saturdays to look forward to. But it was the 30 cents\n",
      "that really got to me.\n",
      "This time Mike smiled.\n",
      "“What are you laughing at?” I asked with anger and frustration.\n",
      "“Dad said this would happen. He said to meet with him when you were\n",
      "ready to quit.”\n",
      "“What?” I said indignantly. “He’s been waiting for me to get fed up?”\n",
      "“Sort of,” Mike said. “Dad’s kind of different. He doesn’t teach like\n",
      "your dad. Your mom and dad lecture a lot. My dad is quiet and a man of\n",
      "few words. You just wait till this Saturday. I’ll tell him you’re ready.”\n",
      "“You mean I’ve been set up?”\n",
      "“No, not really, but maybe. Dad will explain on Saturday.”\n",
      "Waiting in Line on Saturday\n",
      "I was ready to face Mike’s dad. Even my real dad was angry with him.\n",
      "My real dad, the one I call the poor one, thought that my rich dad was\n",
      "violating child labor laws and should be investigated.\n",
      "My educated, poor dad told me to demand what I deserve—at least 25\n",
      "cents an hour. My poor dad told me that if I did not get a raise, I was to quit\n",
      "immediately.\n",
      "“You don’t need that damned job anyway,” said my poor dad with\n",
      "indignation.\n",
      "At eight o’clock Saturday morning, I walked through the door of Mike’s\n",
      "house when Mike’s dad opened it.\n",
      "“Take a seat and wait in line,” he said as I entered. He turned and\n",
      "disappeared into his little office next to a bedroom.\n",
      "I looked around the room and didn’t see Mike anywhere. Feeling\n",
      "awkward, I cautiously sat down next to the same two women who were\n",
      "there four weeks earlier. They smiled and slid down the couch to make\n",
      "room for me.\n",
      "Forty-five minutes went by, and I was steaming. The two women had\n",
      "met with him and left 30 minutes earlier. An older gentleman was in there\n",
      "for 20 minutes and was also gone.\n",
      "The house was empty, and here I sat in a musty, dark living room on a\n",
      "beautiful sunny Hawaiian day, waiting to talk to a cheapskate who exploited\n",
      "children. I could hear him rustling around the office, talking on the phone,\n",
      "and ignoring me. I was ready to walk out, but for some reason I stayed.\n",
      "Finally, 15 minutes later, at exactly nine o’clock, rich dad walked out of\n",
      "his office, said nothing, and signaled with his hand for me to enter.\n",
      "“I understand you want a raise, or you’re going to quit,” rich dad said as\n",
      "he swiveled in his office chair.\n",
      "“Well, you’re not keeping your end of the bargain,” I blurted out, nearly\n",
      "in tears. It was really frightening for me to confront a grown-up.\n",
      "“You said that you would teach me if I worked for you. Well, I’ve\n",

      "Rich dad rocked back in his swivel chair, hands up to his chin, and\n",

      "“Not bad,” he said. “In less than a month, you sound like most of my\n",
      "employees.”\n",
      "“What?” I asked. Not understanding what he was saying, I continued\n",

      "really cruel.”\n",

      "talked to me once since I agreed to work for peanuts. Ten cents an hour.\n",
      "Hah! I should notify the government about you. We have child labor laws,\n",
      "you know. My dad works for the government, you know.”\n",
      "“Wow!” said rich dad. “Now you sound just like most of the people who\n",
      "used to work for me—people I’ve either fired or who have quit.”\n",
      "“So what do you have to say?” I demanded, feeling pretty brave for a\n",
      "little kid. “You lied to me. I’ve worked for you, and you have not kept your\n",
      "word. You haven’t taught me anything.”\n",
      "“How do you know that I’ve not taught you anything?” asked rich dad\n",
      "calmly.\n",
      "“Well, you’ve never talked to me. I’ve worked for three weeks and you\n",
      "have not taught me anything,” I said with a pout.\n",
      "“Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?” rich dad asked.\n",
      "“Well, yes,” I replied.\n",
      "“That’s how they teach you in school,” he said, smiling. “But that is not\n",
      "how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best teacher of all.\n",
      "Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around.\n",
      "Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s something I want you to\n",
      "learn.’”\n",
      "“What is this man talking about?” I asked myself silently. “Life pushing\n",
      "me around was life talking to me?” Now I knew I had to quit my job. I was\n",
      "talking to someone who needed to be locked up.\n",
      "“If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just\n",
      "continue to push you around. People do two things. Some just let life push\n",
      "them around. Others get angry and push back. But they push back against\n",
      "their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it’s life\n",
      "that’s pushing.”\n",
      "I had no idea what he was talking about.\n",
      "“Life pushes all of us around. Some people give up and others fight. A\n",
      "few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around.\n",
      "To these few people, it means they need and want to learn something. They\n",
      "learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight.”\n",
      "Rich dad stood and shut the creaky old wooden window that needed\n",
      "repair. “If you learn this lesson, you will grow into a wise, wealthy, and\n",
      "happy young man. If you don’t, you will spend your life blaming a job, low\n",
      "pay, or your boss for your problems. You’ll live life always hoping for that\n",
      "big break that will solve all your money problems.”\n",
      "Rich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes met\n",
      "mine. We stared at each other, communicating through our eyes. Finally, I\n",
      "looked away once I had absorbed his message. I knew he was right. I was\n",
      "blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I was fighting.\n",
      "Rich dad continued, “Or if you’re the kind of person who has no guts,\n",
      "you just give up every time life pushes you. If you’re that kind of person,\n",
      "you’ll live all your life playing it safe, doing the right things, saving\n",
      "yourself for some event that never happens. Then you die a boring old man.\n",
      "You’ll have lots of friends who really like you because you were such a nice\n",
      "hardworking guy. But the truth is that you let life push you into submission.\n",
      "Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but\n",
      "the fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside,\n",
      "you and only you will know you didn’t go for it. You chose to play it safe.”\n",
      "Our eyes met again.\n",
      "“You’ve been pushing me around?” I asked.\n",
      "“Some people might say that,” smiled rich dad. “I would say that I just\n",
      "gave you a taste of life.”\n",
      "“What taste of life?” I asked, still angry, but now curious and ready to\n",
      "learn.\n",
      "“You boys are the first people who have ever asked me to teach them\n",
      "how to make money. I have more than 150 employees, and not one of them\n",
      "has asked me what I know about money. They ask me for a job and a\n",
      "paycheck, but never to teach them about money. So most will spend the best\n",
      "years of their lives working for money, not really understanding what it is\n",
      "they are working for.”\n",
      "I sat there listening intently.\n",
      "“So when Mike told me you wanted to learn how to make money, I\n",
      "decided to design a course that mirrored real life. I could talk until I was\n",
      "blue in the face, but you wouldn’t hear a thing. So I decided to let life push\n",
      "you around a bit so you could hear me. That’s why I only paid you 10\n",
      "cents.”\n",
      "“So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an\n",
      "hour?” I asked. “That you’re cheap and exploit your workers?”\n",
      "Rich dad rocked back and laughed heartily. Finally he said, “You’d best\n",
      "change your point of view. Stop blaming me and thinking I’m the problem.\n",
      "If you think I’m the problem, then you have to change me. If you realize\n",
      "that you’re the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something, and\n",
      "grow wiser. Most people want everyone else in the world to change but\n",
      "themselves. Let me tell you, it’s easier to change yourself than everyone\n",
      "else.”\n",
      "“I don’t understand,” I said.\n",
      "“Don’t blame me for your problems,” rich dad said, growing impatient.\n",
      "“But you only pay me 10 cents.”\n",
      "“So what are you learning?” rich dad asked, smiling.\n",
      "“That you’re cheap,” I said with a sly grin.\n",
      "“See, you think I’m the problem,” said rich dad.\n",
      "“But you are.”\n",
      "“Well, keep that attitude and you’ll learn nothing. Keep the attitude that\n",
      "I’m the problem and what choices do you have?”\n",
      "“Well, if you don’t pay me more or show me more respect and teach\n",
      "me, I’ll quit.”\n",
      "“Well put,” rich dad said. “And that’s exactly what most people do.\n",
      "They quit and go looking for another job, a better opportunity, and higher\n",
      "pay, actually thinking that this will solve the problem. In most cases, it\n",
      "won’t.”\n",
      "“So what should I do?” I asked. “Just take this measly 10 cents an hour\n",
      "and smile?”\n",
      "Rich dad smiled. “That’s what the other people do. But that’s all they\n",
      "do, waiting for a raise thinking that more money will solve their problems.\n",
      "Most just accept it, and some take a second job working harder, but again\n",
      "accepting a small paycheck.”\n",
      "I sat staring at the floor, beginning to understand the lesson rich dad was\n",
      "presenting. I could sense it was a taste of life. Finally, I looked up and\n",
      "asked, “So what will solve the problem?”\n",
      "“This,” he said, leaning forward in his chair and tapping me gently on\n",
      "the head. “This stuff between your ears.”\n",
      "It was at that moment that rich dad shared the pivotal point of view that\n",
      "separated him from his employees and my poor dad—and led him to\n",
      "eventually become one of the richest men in Hawaii, while my highly\n",
      "educated but poor dad struggled financially all his life. It was a singular\n",
      "point of view that made all the difference over a lifetime.\n",
      "Rich dad explained this point of view over and over, which I call lesson\n",
      "number one: The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have\n",
      "money work for them.\n",
      "On that bright Saturday morning, I learned a completely different point\n",
      "of view from what I had been taught by my poor dad. At the age of nine, I\n",
      "understood that both dads wanted me to learn. Both dads encouraged me to\n",
      "study, but not the same things.\n",
      "My highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did. “Son, I\n",
      "want you to study hard, get good grades, so you can find a safe, secure job\n",
      "with a big company. And make sure it has excellent benefits.” My rich dad\n",
      "wanted me to learn how money works so I could make it work for me.\n",
      "These lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not because\n",
      "of a classroom.\n",
      "My rich dad continued my first lesson, “I’m glad you got angry about\n",
      "working for 10 cents an hour. If you hadn’t got angry and had simply\n",
      "accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could not teach you. You see, true\n",
      "learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger is a big part of\n",
      "that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When it comes to\n",
      "money, most people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does\n",
      "not direct them. Fear does.”\n",
      "“So is that why they’ll take jobs with low pay?” I asked.\n",
      "“Yes,” said rich dad. “Some people say I exploit people because I don’t\n",
      "pay as much as the sugar plantation or the government. I say the people\n",
      "exploit themselves. It’s their fear, not mine.”\n",
      "“But don’t you feel you should pay them more?” I asked.\n",
      "“I don’t have to. And besides, more money will not solve their\n",
      "problems. Just look at your dad. He makes a lot of money, and he still can’t\n",
      "pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get into more debt.”\n",
      "“So that’s why the 10 cents an hour,” I said, smiling. “It’s a part of the\n",
      "lesson.”\n",
      "“That’s right,” smiled rich dad. “You see, your dad went to school and\n",
      "got an excellent education, so he could get a high-paying job. But he still\n",
      "has money problems because he never learned anything about money in\n",
      "school. On top of that, he believes in working for money.”\n",
      "“And you don’t?” I asked.\n",
      "“No, not really,” said rich dad. “If you want to learn to work for money,\n",
      "then stay in school. That is a great place to learn to do that. But if you want\n",
      "to learn how to have money work for you, then I will teach you that. But\n",
      "only if you want to learn.”\n",
      "“Wouldn’t everyone want to learn that?” I asked.\n",
      "“No,” said rich dad, “simply because it’s easier to learn to work for\n",
      "money, especially if fear is your primary emotion when the subject of\n",
      "money is discussed.”\n",
      "“I don’t understand,” I said with a frown.\n",
      "“Don’t worry about that for now. Just know that it’s fear that keeps most\n",
      "people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being\n",
      "fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over.\n",
      "That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working\n",
      "for money. Most people become a slave to money—and then get angry at\n",
      "their boss.”\n",
      "“Learning to have money work for you is a completely different course\n",
      "of study?” I asked.\n",
      "“Absolutely,” rich dad answered. “Absolutely.”\n",
      "We sat in silence on that beautiful Hawaiian Saturday morning. My\n",
      "friends had just started their Little League baseball game, but for some\n",
      "reason I was now thankful I had decided to work for 10 cents an hour. I\n",
      "sensed that I was about to learn something my friends wouldn’t learn in\n",
      "school.\n",
      "“Ready to learn?” asked rich dad.\n",
      "“Absolutely,” I said with a grin.\n",
      "“I have kept my promise. I’ve been teaching you from afar,” my rich\n",
      "dad said. “At nine years old, you’ve gotten a taste of what it feels like to\n",
      "work for money. Just multiply your last month by fifty years and you will\n",
      "have an idea of what most people spend their life doing.”\n",
      "“I don’t understand,” I said.\n",
      "“How did you feel waiting in line to see me, once to get hired and once\n",
      "to ask for more money?”\n",
      "“Terrible,” I said.\n",
      "“If you choose to work for money, that is what life will be like,” said\n",
      "rich dad.\n",
      "“And how did you feel when Mrs. Martin dropped three dimes in your\n",
      "hand for three hours of work?”\n",
      "“I felt like it wasn’t enough. It seemed like nothing. I was\n",
      "disappointed,” I said.\n",
      "“And that is how most employees feel when they look at their\n",
      "paychecks—especially after all the tax and other deductions are taken out.\n",
      "At least you got 100 percent.”\n",
      "“You mean most workers don’t get paid everything?” I asked with\n",
      "amazement.\n",
      "“Heavens no!” said rich dad. “The government always takes its share\n",
      "first.”\n",
      "“How do they do that?” I asked.\n",
      "“Taxes,” said rich dad. “You’re taxed when you earn. You’re taxed\n",
      "when you spend. You’re taxed when you save. You’re taxed when you die.”\n",
      "“Why do people let the government do that to them?”\n",
      "“The rich don’t,” said rich dad with a smile. “The poor and the middle\n",
      "class do. I’ll bet you that I earn more than your dad, yet he pays more in\n",
      "taxes.”\n",
      "“How can that be?” I asked. At my age, that made no sense to me.\n",
      "“Why would someone let the government do that to them?”\n",
      "Rich dad rocked slowly and silently in his chair, just looking at me.\n",
      "“Ready to learn?” he asked.\n",
      "I nodded my head slowly.\n",
      "“As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work for\n",
      "you is a lifetime study. Most people go to college for four years, and their\n",
      "education ends. I already know that my study of money will continue over\n",
      "my lifetime, simply because the more I find out, the more I find out I need\n",
      "to know. Most people never study the subject. They go to work, get their\n",
      "paycheck, balance their checkbooks, and that’s it. Then they wonder why\n",
      "they have money problems. They think that more money will solve the\n",
      "problem and don’t realize that it’s their lack of financial education that is\n",
      "the problem.”\n",
      "“So my dad has tax problems because he doesn’t understand money?” I\n",
      "asked, confused.\n",
      "“Look,” said rich dad, “taxes are just one small section on learning how\n",
      "to have money work for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if you still\n",
      "have the passion to learn about money. Most people don’t. They want to go\n",
      "to school, learn a profession, have fun at their work, and earn lots of money.\n",
      "One day they wake up with big money problems, and then they can’t stop\n",
      "working. That’s the price of only knowing how to work for money instead\n",
      "of studying how to have money work for you. So do you still have the\n",
      "passion to learn?” asked rich dad.\n",
      "I nodded my head.\n",
      "“Good,” said rich dad. “Now get back to work. This time, I will pay you\n",
      "nothing.”\n",
      "“What?” I asked in amazement.\n",
      "“You heard me. Nothing. You will work the same three hours every\n",
      "Saturday, but this time you will not be paid 10 cents per hour. You said you\n",
      "wanted to learn to not work for money, so I’m not going to pay you\n",

      "lots of money only to be in debt up to his eyeballs, hoping more money will\n",
      "solve the problem. If that’s what you want, I’ll go back to our original deal\n",
      "of 10 cents an hour. Or you can do what most adults do: Complain that\n",

      "“But what do I do?” I asked.\n",

      "understood, and I didn’t want to try to explain something I didn’t\n",
      "understand myself.\n",
      "For three more weeks, Mike and I worked three hours every Saturday\n",
      "for nothing. The work didn’t bother me, and the routine got easier, but it\n",
      "was the missed baseball games and not being able to afford to buy a few\n",
      "comic books that got to me.\n",
      "Rich dad stopped by at noon on the third week. We heard his truck pull\n",
      "up in the parking lot and sputter when the engine was turned off. He entered\n",
      "the store and greeted Mrs. Martin with a hug. After finding out how things\n",
      "were going in the store, he reached into the ice-cream freezer, pulled out\n",
      "two bars, paid for them, and signaled to Mike and me.\n",
      "“Let’s go for a walk, boys.”\n",
      "We crossed the street, dodging a few cars, and walked across a large\n",
      "grassy field where a few adults were playing softball. Sitting down at a lone\n",

      "and ridiculous. Not many grown-ups in 1956 made more than that, but\n",
      "quickly my temptation disappeared, and calm set in. Slowly, I turned to my\n",
      "left to look at Mike. He looked back at me. The part of my soul that was\n",
      "weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that had no price took over. I\n",
      "knew Mike had gotten to that point too.\n",
      "People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and\n",
      "greed.\n",
      "“Good,” rich dad said softly. “Most people have a price. And they have\n",
      "a price because of human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of\n",
      "being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that\n",
      "paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things\n",
      "money can buy. The pattern is then set.”\n",
      "“What pattern?” I asked.\n",
      "“The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go to work, pay\n",
      "bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.\n",
      "Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by increasing their\n",
      "spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.”\n",
      "“There is another way?” Mike asked.\n",
      "“Yes,” said rich dad slowly. “But only a few people find it.”\n",
      "“And what is that way?” Mike asked.\n",
      "“That’s what I hope you boys will learn as you work and study with me.\n",
      "That is why I took away all forms of pay.”\n",
      "“Any hints?” Mike asked. “We’re kind of tired of working hard,\n",
      "especially for nothing.”\n",
      "“Well, the first step is telling the truth,” said rich dad.\n",
      "“We haven’t been lying,” I said.\n",
      "“I did not say you were lying. I said to tell the truth,” rich dad retorted.\n",
      "“The truth about what?” I asked.\n",
      "“How you’re feeling,” rich dad said. “You don’t have to say it to anyone\n",
      "else. Just admit it to yourself.”\n",
      "“You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you, Mrs.\n",
      "Martin, they don’t do that?” I asked.\n",
      "“I doubt it,” said rich dad. “Instead, they feel the fear of not having\n",
      "money. They don’t confront it logically. They react emotionally instead of\n",
      "using their heads,” rich dad said. “Then, they get a few bucks in their hands\n",
      "and again, the emotions of joy, desire, and greed take over. And again they\n",
      "react, instead of think.”\n",
      "“So their emotions control their brain,” Mike said.\n",
      "“That’s correct,” said rich dad. “Instead of admitting the truth about\n",
      "how they feel, they react to their feelings and fail to think. They feel the\n",
      "fear so they go to work, hoping that money will soothe the fear, but it\n",
      "doesn’t. It continues to haunt them and they return to work, hoping again\n",
      "that money will calm their fears, and again it doesn’t. Fear keeps them in\n",
      "this trap of working, earning money, working, earning money, hoping the\n",
      "fear will go away. But every day they get up, and that old fear wakes up\n",
      "with them. For millions of people that old fear keeps them awake all night,\n",
      "causing a night of turmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping\n",
      "that a paycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running\n",
      "their lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that. Money is in control of\n",
      "their emotions and their souls.”\n",
      "Rich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard what he\n",
      "said but didn’t understand fully what he was talking about. I just knew that I\n",
      "often wondered why grown-ups hurried off to work. It did not seem like\n",
      "much fun, and they never looked that happy, but something kept them\n",
      "going.\n",
      "Realizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was talking\n",
      "about, rich dad said, “I want you boys to avoid that trap. That is really what\n",
      "I want to teach you. Not just to be rich, because being rich does not solve\n",
      "the problem.”\n",
      "“It doesn’t?” I asked, surprised.\n",
      "“No, it doesn’t. Let me explain the other emotion: desire. Some call it\n",
      "greed, but I prefer desire. It’s perfectly normal to desire something better,\n",
      "prettier, more fun, or exciting. So people also work for money because of\n",
      "desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that\n",
      "money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need more money for more\n",
      "joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more security. So they keep working,\n",
      "thinking money will soothe their souls that are troubled by fear and desire.\n",
      "But money can’t do that.”\n",
      "“Even rich people do this?” Mike asked.\n",
      "“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich\n",
      "people are rich isn’t because of desire, but because of fear. They believe\n",
      "that money can eliminate the fear of being poor, so they amass tons of it,\n",
      "only to find the fear gets worse. Now they fear losing the money. I have\n",
      "friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people\n",
      "who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor.\n",
      "They’re terrified of losing it all. The fears that drove them to get rich got\n",
      "worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming louder.\n",
      "They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars and the high life money has\n",
      "bought them. They worry about what their friends would say if they lost all\n",
      "their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they\n",
      "look rich and have more money.”\n",
      "“So is a poor man happier?” I asked.\n",
      "“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money is just\n",
      "as psychotic as being attached to money.”\n",
      "As if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by the large\n",
      "rubbish can and rummaging around in it. The three of us watched him with\n",
      "great interest, when before we probably would have just ignored him.\n",
      "Rich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the older man.\n",
      "Seeing the money, the derelict came over immediately, took the bill,\n",
      "thanked rich dad profusely, and hurried off, ecstatic with his good fortune.\n",
      "“He’s not much different from most of my employees,” said rich dad.\n",
      "“I’ve met so many people who say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in money.’ Yet\n",
      "they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day. That’s a denial of truth. If they\n",
      "weren’t interested in money, then why are they working? That kind of\n",
      "thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who hoards money.”\n",
      "As I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind flashed back to the\n",
      "countless times my own dad said, “I’m not interested in money.” He said\n",
      "those words often. He also covered himself by always saying, “I work\n",
      "because I love my job.”\n",
      "So many people say, “Oh, I’m not interested in money.” Yet\n",
      "they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day.\n",
      "“So what do we do?” I asked. “Not work for money until all traces of\n",
      "fear and greed are gone?”\n",
      "“No, that would be a waste of time,” said rich dad. “Emotions are what\n",
      "make us human. The word ‘emotion’ stands for ‘energy in motion.’ Be\n",
      "truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in your favor,\n",
      "not against yourself.”\n",
      "“Whoa!” said Mike.\n",
      "“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in years to\n",
      "come. Just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. Most people do\n",
      "not know that it’s their emotions that are doing the thinking. Your emotions\n",
      "are your emotions, but you have got to learn to do your own thinking.”\n",
      "“Can you give me an example?” I asked.\n",
      "“Sure,” replied rich dad. “When a person says, ‘I need to find a job,’ it’s\n",
      "most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not having money\n",
      "generates that thought.”\n",
      "“But people do need money if they have bills to pay,” I said.\n",
      "“Sure they do,” smiled rich dad. “All I’m saying is that it’s fear that is\n",
      "all too often doing the thinking.”\n",
      "“I don’t understand,” said Mike.\n",
      "“For example,” said rich dad. “If the fear of not having enough money\n",
      "arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job, they instead might\n",
      "ask themselves this question: ‘Will a job be the best solution to this fear\n",
      "over the long run?’ In my opinion, the answer is no. A job is really a short-\n",
      "term solution to a long-term problem.”\n",
      "“But my dad is always saying, ‘Stay in school and get good grades, so\n",
      "you can find a safe, secure job,’” I interjected, somewhat confused.\n",
      "“Yes, I understand he says that,” said rich dad, smiling. “Most people\n",
      "recommend that, and it’s a good path for most people. But people make that\n",
      "recommendation primarily out of fear.”\n",
      "“You mean my dad says that because he’s afraid?”\n",
      "“Yes,” said rich dad. “He’s terrified that you won’t earn enough money\n",
      "and won’t fit into society. Don’t get me wrong. He loves you and wants the\n",
      "best for you. I too believe an education and a job are important, but it won’t\n",
      "handle the fear. You see, that same fear that makes him get up in the\n",
      "morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to be so fanatical\n",
      "about your going to school.”\n",
      "“So what do you recommend?” I asked.\n",
      "“I want to teach you to master the power of money, instead of being\n",
      "afraid of it. They don’t teach that in school and, if you don’t learn it, you\n",
      "become a slave to money.”\n",
      "It was finally making sense. He wanted us to widen our views and to see\n",
      "what the Mrs. Martins of this world couldn’t see. He used examples that\n",
      "sounded cruel at the time, but I’ve never forgotten them. My vision widened\n",
      "that day, and I began to see the trap that lay ahead for most people.\n",
      "“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different\n",
      "levels,” said rich dad. “I just want you boys to have a chance to avoid the\n",
      "trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire. Use them in your favor,\n",
      "not against you. That’s what I want to teach you. I’m not interested in just\n",
      "teaching you to make a pile of money. That won’t handle the fear or desire.\n",
      "If you don’t first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you’ll only be a\n",
      "highly paid slave.”\n",
      "“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked.\n",
      "“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance,\n",
      "not the economy or the government or the rich. It’s self-inflicted fear and\n",
      "ignorance that keep people trapped. So you boys go to school and get your\n",
      "college degrees, and I’ll teach you how to stay out of the trap.”\n",
      "The pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad had a\n",
      "great education and a great career, but school never told him how to handle\n",
      "money or his fear of it. It became clear that I could learn different and\n",
      "important things from two fathers.\n",
      "“So you’ve been talking about the fear of not having money. How does\n",
      "the desire for money affect our thinking?” Mike asked.\n",
      "“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you notice\n",
      "your desires rising?”\n",
      "We nodded our heads.\n",
      "“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay your\n",
      "reactions and think. That is important. We will always have emotions of\n",
      "fear and greed. From here on in, it’s imperative for you to use those\n",
      "emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not let your emotions\n",
      "control your thinking. Most people use fear and greed against themselves.\n",
      "That’s the start of ignorance. Most people live their lives chasing\n",
      "paychecks, pay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire\n",
      "and fear, not really questioning where those emotion-driven thoughts are\n",
      "leading them. It’s just like the picture of a donkey dragging a cart with its\n",
      "owner dangling a carrot just in front of its nose. The donkey’s owner may\n",
      "be going where he wants to, but the donkey is chasing an illusion.\n",
      "Tomorrow there will only be another carrot for the donkey.”\n",
      "“You mean the moment I picture a new baseball glove, candy and toys,\n",
      "that’s like a carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked.\n",
      "“Yes, and as you get older, your toys get more expensive—a new car, a\n",
      "boat, and a big house to impress your friends,” said rich dad with a smile.\n",
      "“Fear pushes you out the door, and desire calls to you. That’s the trap.”\n",
      "“So what’s the answer,” Mike asked.\n",
      "“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich people\n",
      "with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get. Money is the\n",
      "carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the whole picture, it might\n",
      "rethink its choice to chase the carrot.”\n",
      "Rich dad went on to explain that a human’s life is a struggle between\n",
      "ignorance and illumination.\n",
      "He explained that once a person stops searching for information and\n",
      "self-knowledge, ignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-moment\n",
      "decision—to learn to open or close one’s mind.\n",
      "“Look, school is very important. You go to school to learn a skill or\n",
      "profession to become a contributing member of society. Every culture needs\n",
      "teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, cooks, businesspeople, police officers,\n",
      "firefighters, and soldiers. Schools train them so society can thrive and\n",
      "flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people school is the end,\n",
      "not the beginning.”\n",
      "There was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I didn’t comprehend\n",
      "everything he said that day. But as with most great teachers, his words\n",
      "continued to teach for years.\n",
      "“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. “But I want you to always\n",
      "remember this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs. Martin. And I want\n",
      "you always to remember that donkey. Never forget that fear and desire can\n",
      "lead you into life’s biggest trap if you’re not aware of them controlling your\n",
      "thinking. To spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is\n",
      "cruel. To work hard for money, thinking that it will buy you things that will\n",
      "make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night\n",
      "terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated\n",
      "by the size of a paycheck is not really living a life. Thinking that a job\n",
      "makes you secure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I\n",
      "want you to avoid. I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that\n",
      "happen to you. Please don’t let money run your life.”\n",
      "A softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw it\n",
      "back.\n",
      "“So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?” I asked.\n",
      "“Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and\n",
      "fear,” said rich dad. “Let me give you some examples. A doctor, wanting\n",
      "more money to better provide for his family, raises his fees. By raising his\n",
      "fees, it makes health care more expensive for everyone.\n",
      "It hurts the poor people the most, so they have worse health than those\n",
      "with money. Because the doctors raise their fees, the attorneys raise their\n",
      "fees. Because the attorneys’ fees have gone up, schoolteachers want a raise,\n",
      "which raises our taxes, and on and on and on. Soon there will be such a\n",
      "horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos will break out and\n",
      "another great civilization will collapse. History proves that great\n",
      "civilizations collapse when the gap between the haves and have-nots is too\n",
      "great. Sadly, America is on that same course because we haven’t learned\n",
      "from history. We only memorize historical dates and names, not the lesson.”\n",
      "“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked.\n",
      "“In an educated society with a well-run government, prices should\n",
      "actually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory. Prices go\n",
      "up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools taught people\n",
      "about money, there would be more money and lower prices. But schools\n",
      "focus only on teaching people to work for money, not how to harness\n",
      "money’s power.”\n",
      "“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “And haven’t you\n",
      "encouraged me to go for my MBA?”\n",
      "“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often business schools train employees\n",
      "to become sophisticated bean-counters. Heaven forbid a bean-counter takes\n",
      "over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire people, and kill the\n",
      "business. I know this because I hire bean-counters. All they think about is\n",
      "cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more problems. Bean-counting\n",
      "is important. I wish more people knew it, but it, too, is not the whole\n",
      "picture,” added rich dad angrily.\n",
      "“So is there an answer?” asked Mike.\n",
      "“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not think\n",
      "with your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions by agreeing to\n",
      "work for free, I knew there was hope. When you again resisted your\n",
      "emotions when I tempted you with more money, you were again learning to\n",
      "think in spite of being emotionally charged. That’s the first step.”\n",
      "“Why is that step so important?” I asked.\n",
      "“Well, that’s up to you to find out. If you want to learn, I’ll take you\n",
      "boys into the briar patch, a place almost everyone else avoids. If you go\n",
      "with me, you’ll let go of the idea of working for money and instead learn to\n",
      "have money work for you.”\n",
      "“And what will we get if we go with you. What if we agree to learn\n",
      "from you? What will we get?” I asked.\n",
      "“The same thing Brer Rabbit got,” said rich dad, referring to the classic\n",
      "children’s story.\n",
      "“Is there a briar patch?” I asked.\n",
      "“Yes,” said rich dad. “The briar patch is our fear and greed. Confronting\n",
      "fear, weaknesses, and neediness by choosing our own thoughts is the way\n",
      "out.”\n",
      "“Choosing our thoughts?” Mike asked, puzzled.\n",
      "“Yes. Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions.\n",
      "Instead of just getting up and going to work because not having the money\n",
      "to pay your bills is scaring you, ask yourself, ‘Is working harder at this the\n",
      "best solution to this problem?’ Most people are too afraid to rationally think\n",
      "things through and instead run out the door to a job they hate. The Tar Baby\n",
      "is in control. That’s what I mean by choosing your thoughts.”\n",
      "“And how do we do that?” Mike asked.\n",
      "“That’s what I will teach you. I’ll teach you to have a choice of thoughts\n",
      "rather than a knee-jerk reaction, like gulping down your morning coffee and\n",
      "running out the door.\n",
      "“Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term solution to a\n",
      "long-term problem. Most people have only one problem in mind, and it’s\n",
      "short-term. It’s the bills at the end of the month, the Tar Baby. Money\n",
      "controls their lives, or should I say the fear and ignorance about money\n",
      "controls it. So they do as their parents did. They get up every day and go\n",
      "work for money, not taking the time to ask the question, ‘Is there another\n",
      "way?’ Their emotions now control their thinking, not their heads.”\n",
      "“Can you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the head\n",
      "thinking?” Mike asked.\n",
      "“Oh, yes. I hear it all the time,” said rich dad. “I hear things like, ‘Well,\n",
      "everyone has to work.’ Or ‘The rich are crooks.’ Or ‘I’ll get another job. I\n",
      "deserve this raise. You can’t push me around.’ Or ‘I like this job because\n",
      "it’s secure.’ No one asks, ‘Is there something I’m missing here?’ which\n",
      "would break through the emotional thought and give you time to think\n",
      "clearly.”\n",
      "As we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich really\n",
      "did “make money.” They did not work for it. He went on to explain that\n",
      "when Mike and I were casting five-cent pieces out of lead, thinking we\n",
      "were making money, we were very close to thinking the way the rich think.\n",
      "The problem was that creating money is legal for the government and banks\n",
      "to do, but illegal for us to do. There are legal ways to create money from\n",
      "nothing, he told us.\n",
      "Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an\n",
      "illusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey. It’s only out of fear and greed\n",
      "that the illusion of money is held together by billions of people who believe\n",
      "that money is real. It’s not. Money is really made up. It is only because of\n",
      "the illusion of confidence and the ignorance of the masses that this house of\n",
      "cards stands.\n",
      "He talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that each\n",
      "dollar bill was actually a silver certificate. What concerned him was the\n",
      "rumor that we would someday go off the gold standard and our dollars\n",
      "would no longer be backed by something tangible.\n",
      "“If that happens, boys, all hell will break loose. The poor, the middle\n",

      "continue to believe that money is real and that the company they work for,\n",
      "or the government, will look after them.”\n",

      "Keep It Super Simple)—so he kept it simple for us, and that made our\n",

      "So what causes the confusion? How could something so simple be so\n",

      "The answer is found in basic education.\n",
      "We focus on the word “literacy” and not “financial literacy.” What\n",
      "defines something to be an asset or a liability are not words. In fact, if you\n",

      "An asset puts money in my pocket. A liability takes money out of\n",
      "my pocket.\n",
      "To us young boys, rich dad said, “What defines an asset are not words,\n",

      "Here is how to tell the difference between an asset and a liability. Most\n",
      "accountants and financial professionals do not agree with the definitions,\n",

      "two young boys.\n",
      "This is the cash-flow pattern of an asset:\n",
      "The top part of the diagram is an Income Statement, often called a\n",
      "Profit-and-Loss Statement. It measures income and expenses: money in and\n",
      "money out. The lower part of the diagram is a Balance Sheet. It’s called that\n",
      "because it’s supposed to balance assets against liabilities. Many financial\n",
      "novices do not know the relationship between the Income Statement and the\n",
      "Balance Sheet, and it is vital to understand that relationship.\n",
      "So as I said earlier, my rich dad simply told two young boys that “assets\n",
      "put money in your pocket.” Nice, simple, and usable.\n",
      "This is the cash-flow pattern of a liability:\n",
      "Now that assets and liabilities have been defined through pictures, it\n",
      "may be easier to understand my definitions in words. An asset is something\n",
      "that puts money in my pocket. A liability is something that takes money out\n",
      "of my pocket. This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich,\n",

      "the financial story paints a picture of hard work to get ahead. However, this\n",

      "AND THE POWER OF\n",
      "CORPORATIONS\n",
      "My rich dad just played the game smart, and he did it through\n",
      "corporations—the biggest secret of the rich.\n",
      "I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his Merry\n",
      "Men. My teacher thought it was a wonderful story of a romantic hero who\n",
      "robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. My rich dad did not see Robin\n",
      "Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.\n",
      "Robin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. I often still\n",
      "hear people say, “Why don’t the rich pay for it?” or “The rich should pay\n",
      "more in taxes and give it to the poor.”\n",
      "It is this Robin Hood fantasy, or taking from the rich to give to the poor,\n",
      "that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason\n",
      "the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the Robin Hood ideal. The\n",
      "reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the middle class, especially the\n",
      "educated upper-income middle class, who pays for the poor.\n",
      "Again, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look at the\n",
      "history of taxes. Although my highly educated dad was an expert on the\n",
      "history of education, my rich dad fashioned himself as an expert on the\n",
      "history of taxes.\n",
      "Rich dad explained to Mike and me that originally, in England and\n",
      "America, there were no taxes. Occasionally, there were temporary taxes\n",
      "levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the president would put the\n",
      "word out and ask everyone to “chip in.” Taxes were levied in Britain for the\n",
      "fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in America to pay for the\n",
      "Civil War from 1861 to 1865.\n",
      "In 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. In\n",
      "1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States with the\n",
      "adoption of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. At one time,\n",
      "Americans were anti-tax. It had been the tax on tea that led to the famous\n",
      "Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the Revolutionary\n",
      "War. It took approximately 50 years in both England and the United States\n",
      "to sell the idea of a regular income tax.\n",
      "What these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes were\n",
      "initially levied against only the rich. It was this point that rich dad wanted\n",
      "Mike and me to understand. He explained that the idea of taxes was made\n",
      "popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and the middle\n",
      "class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is how the masses\n",
      "voted for the law, and it became constitutionally legal. Although it was\n",
      "intended to punish the rich, in reality it wound up punishing the very people\n",
      "who voted for it, the poor and middle class.\n",
      "“Once government got a taste of money, its appetite grew,” said rich\n",
      "dad. “Your dad and I are exactly opposite. He’s a government bureaucrat,\n",
      "and I am a capitalist. We get paid, and our success is measured on opposite\n",
      "behaviors. He gets paid to spend money and hire people. The more he\n",
      "spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization becomes. In\n",
      "the government, a large organization is a respected organization. On the\n",
      "other hand, within my organization, the fewer people I hire and the less\n",
      "money I spend, the more I am respected by my investors. That’s why I don’t\n",
      "like government people. They have different objectives than most business\n",
      "people. As the government grows, more and more tax dollars are needed to\n",
      "support it.”\n",
      "My educated dad sincerely believed that government should help\n",
      "people. He loved John F. Kennedy and especially the idea of the Peace\n",
      "Corps. He loved the idea so much that both he and my mom worked for the\n",
      "Peace Corps, training volunteers to go to Malaysia, Thailand, and the\n",
      "Philippines. He always strived for additional grants and budget increases so\n",
      "he could hire more people, both in his job with the Education Department\n",
      "and in the Peace Corps.\n",
      "From the time I was about 10 years old, I would hear from my rich dad\n",
      "that government workers were a pack of lazy thieves, and from my poor\n",
      "dad I would hear how the rich were greedy crooks who should be made to\n",
      "pay more taxes. Both sides had valid points. It was difficult to go to work\n",
      "for one of the biggest capitalists in town and come home to a father who\n",
      "was a prominent government leader. It was not easy to know which dad to\n",
      "believe.\n",
      "My rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin\n",
      "Hood a crook.\n",
      "Yet when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective\n",
      "emerges. As I said, the passage of taxes was only possible because the\n",
      "masses believed in the Robin Hood theory of economics: Take from the\n",
      "rich, and give to everyone else. The problem was that the government’s\n",
      "appetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on the\n",
      "middle class, and from there it kept trickling down.\n",
      "However, the rich saw an opportunity because they don’t play by the\n",
      "same set of rules. The rich knew about corporations, which became popular\n",
      "in the days of sailing ships. The rich created the corporation as a vehicle to\n",
      "limit their risk to the assets of each voyage. The rich put their money into a\n",
      "corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation would then hire a crew\n",
      "to sail to the New World to look for treasure. If the ship was lost, the crew\n",
      "lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would be limited only to the money\n",
      "they invested for that particular voyage. The diagram that follows shows\n",
      "how the corporate structure sits outside your personal income statement and\n",
      "balance sheet.\n",
      "It is the knowledge of the legal corporate structure that really gives the\n",
      "rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class. Having two\n",
      "fathers teaching me, one a socialist and the other a capitalist, I quickly\n",
      "began to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist made more financial\n",
      "sense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized\n",
      "themselves due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the\n",
      "“take-from-the-rich” crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to\n",
      "outsmart them. That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle\n",
      "class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals solely because they understood\n",
      "the power of money, a subject not taught in schools.\n",
      "How did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the “take-from-the-\n",
      "rich” tax was passed, cash started flowing into government coffers. Initially,\n",
      "people were happy. Money was handed out to government workers and the\n",
      "rich. It went to government workers in the form of jobs and pensions, and it\n",
      "went to the rich via their factories receiving government contracts. The\n",
      "government received a large pool of money, but the problem was the fiscal\n",
      "management of that money. The government ideal is to avoid having excess\n",
      "money. If you fail to spend your allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next\n",
      "budget. You would certainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business\n",
      "people, on the other hand, are rewarded for having excess money and are\n",
      "applauded for their efficiency. As this cycle of growing government\n",
      "spending continued, the demand for money increased, and the “tax-the-\n",

      "people who voted it in, the poor and the middle class.\n",
      "True capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find an escape.\n",
      "They headed back to the protection of a corporation. But what many people\n",
      "who have never formed a corporation don’t know is that a corporation is not\n",
      "really a thing. A corporation is merely a file folder with some legal\n",
      "documents in it, sitting in some attorney’s office and registered with a state\n",
      "government agency. It’s not a big building or a factory or a group of people.\n",
      "A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a\n",
      "soul. Using it, the wealth of the rich was once again protected. It was\n",
      "popular because the income-tax rate of a corporation is less than the\n",
      "individual income-tax rates. In addition, certain expenses could be paid by a\n",
      "corporation with pre-tax dollars.\n",
      "This war between the haves and have-nots has raged for hundreds of\n",
      "years. The battle is waged whenever and wherever laws are made, and it\n",
      "will go on forever. The problem is that the people who lose are the\n",
      "uninformed: the ones who get up every day and diligently go to work and\n",
      "pay taxes. If they only understood the way the rich play the game, they\n",
      "could play it too. Then they would be on their way to their own financial\n",
      "independence. This is why I cringe every time I hear a parent advise their\n",

      "with a safe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape.\n",
      "Average Americans today work four to five months for the government\n",
      "just to cover their taxes. In my opinion, that is simply too long. The harder\n",
      "you work, the more you pay the government. That is why I believe that the\n",

      "3.\n",
      "Understanding markets\n",
      "Understanding markets is the science of supply and demand. You\n",
      "need to know the technical aspects of the market, which are\n",
      "emotion-driven, in addition to the fundamental or economic aspects\n",
      "of an investment. Does an investment make sense or does it not\n",
      "make sense based on current market conditions?\n",

      "person who understands the tax advantages and protections\n",

      "A corporation can do many things that an employee cannot, like\n",
      "pay expenses before paying taxes. That is a whole area of\n",
      "expertise that is very exciting. Employees earn and get taxed,\n",
      "and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends\n",
      "everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. It’s one\n",
      "of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They’re easy\n",

      "dollars.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Protection from lawsuits\n",
      "We live in a litigious society. Everybody wants a piece of your\n",
      "action. The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such\n",
      "as corporations and trusts to protect their assets from creditors.\n",

      "with layers of legal protection and often find that the wealthy\n",

      "the rich, and give it to the poor.\n",
      "It is not the purpose of this book to go into the specifics of owning a\n",
      "corporation. But I will say that if you own any kind of legitimate assets, I\n",
      "would consider finding out more about the benefits and protection offered\n",
      "by a corporation as soon as possible. There are many books written on the\n",
      "subject that will detail the benefits and even walk you through the steps\n",
      "necessary to set up a corporation. Garret Sutton’s books on corporations\n",
      "provide wonderful insight into the power of personal corporations.\n",
      "Financial IQ is actually the synergy of many skills and talents. I would\n",
      "say it is the combination of the four technical skills listed above that make\n",
      "up basic financial intelligence. If you aspire to great wealth, it is the\n",
      "combination of these skills that will greatly amplify your financial\n",

      "Last night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV program on\n",
      "the history of a young man named Alexander Graham Bell. Bell had just\n",
      "patented his telephone and was having growing pains because the demand\n",
      "for his new invention was so strong. Needing a bigger company, he then\n",
      "went to the giant at that time, Western Union, and asked them if they would\n",
      "buy his patent and his tiny company. He wanted $100,000 for the whole\n",
      "package. The president of Western Union scoffed at him and turned him\n",
      "down, saying the price was ridiculous. The rest is history. A multi-billion-\n",
      "dollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born.\n",
      "The evening news came on right after the story of Alexander Graham\n",
      "Bell. On the news was a story of another downsizing at a local company.\n",
      "The workers were angry and complained that the company ownership was\n",
      "unfair. A terminated manager of about 45 years of age had his wife and two\n",
      "babies at the plant and was begging the guards to let him talk to the owners\n",
      "to ask if they would reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house\n",
      "and was afraid of losing it. The camera focused in on his pleading for all the\n",
      "world to see. Needless to say, it held my attention.\n",
      "I have been teaching professionally since 1984. It has been a great\n",
      "experience and a rewarding one. It is also a disturbing profession, for I have\n",
      "taught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common in all of us,\n",
      "myself included. We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed\n",
      "with gifts. Yet the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-\n",
      "doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that holds us back,\n",
      "but more the lack of self-confidence. Some are more affected than others.\n",
      "Once we leave school, most of us know that it is not so much a matter\n",
      "of college degrees or good grades that count. In the real world outside of\n",
      "academics, something more than just grades is required. I have heard it\n",
      "called many things; guts, chutzpah, balls, audacity, bravado, cunning,\n",
      "daring, tenacity, and brilliance. This factor, whatever it is labeled, ultimately\n",
      "decides one’s future much more than school grades do.\n",
      "Inside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant, and daring characters.\n",
      "There is also the flip side of that character: people who could get down on\n",
      "their knees and beg if necessary. After a year in Vietnam as a Marine Corps\n",
      "pilot, I got to know both of those characters inside of me intimately. One is\n",
      "not better than the other.\n",
      "Yet as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and self-doubt\n",
      "that were the greatest detractors of personal genius. It broke my heart to see\n",
      "students know the answers, yet lack the courage to act on the answer. Often\n",
      "in the real world, it’s not the smart who get ahead, but the bold.\n",
      "In my personal experience, your financial genius requires both technical\n",
      "knowledge as well as courage. If fear is too strong, the genius is suppressed.\n",
      "In my classes, I strongly urge students to learn to take risks, to be bold, and\n",
      "to let their genius convert that fear into power and brilliance. It works for\n",
      "some and just terrifies others. I have come to realize that for most people,\n",
      "when it comes to the subject of money, they would rather play it safe. I have\n",
      "had to field questions such as: “Why take risks?” “Why should I bother\n",
      "developing my financial IQ?” “Why should I become financially literate?”\n",
      "And I answer, “Just to have more options.”\n",
      "There are huge changes up ahead. In the coming years, there will be\n",
      "more people just like the young inventor Alexander Graham Bell. There\n",
      "will be a hundred people like Bill Gates and hugely successful companies\n",
      "like Microsoft created every year, all over the world. And there also will be\n",
      "many more bankruptcies, layoffs, and downsizings.\n",
      "So why bother developing your financial IQ? No one can answer that\n",
      "but you. Yet I can tell you why I myself do it. I do it because it is the most\n",
      "exciting time to be alive. I’d rather be welcoming change than dreading\n",
      "change. I’d rather be excited about making millions than worrying about\n",
      "not getting a raise. This period we are in now is a most exciting time,\n",
      "unprecedented in our world’s history. Generations from now, people will\n",
      "look back at this period of time and remark at what an exciting era it must\n",
      "have been. It was the death of the old and birth of the new. It was full of\n",
      "turmoil, and it was exciting.\n",
      "So why bother developing your financial IQ? Because if you do, you\n",
      "will prosper greatly. And if you don’t, this period of time will be a\n",

      "forward while others cling to worn-out life preservers.\n",
      "Land was wealth 300 years ago. So the person who owned the land\n",
      "owned the wealth. Later, wealth was in factories and production, and\n",
      "America rose to dominance. The industrialist owned the wealth. Today,\n",
      "wealth is in information. And the person who has the most timely\n",
      "information owns the wealth. The problem is that information flies around\n",
      "the world at the speed of light. The new wealth cannot be contained by\n",

      "faster and more dramatic. There will be a dramatic increase in the number\n",
      "of new multimillionaires. There also will be those who are left behind.\n",
      "I find so many people struggling today, often working harder, simply\n",
      "because they cling to old ideas. They want things to be the way they were,\n",
      "and they resist change. I know people who are losing their jobs or their\n",
      "houses, and they blame technology or the economy or their boss. Sadly,\n",
      "they fail to realize that they might be the problem. Old ideas are their\n",

      "One afternoon I was teaching how to invest using a board game I had\n",
      "invented, CASHFLOW®, as a teaching tool. A friend had brought someone\n",
      "along to attend the class. This friend of a friend was recently divorced, had\n",
      "been badly burned in the divorce settlement, and was now searching for\n",
      "some answers. Her friend thought the class might help.\n",
      "The game was designed to help people learn how money works. In\n",
      "playing the game, they learn about the interaction of the income statement\n",
      "with the balance sheet. They learn how cash flows between the two and\n",
      "how the road to wealth is through striving to increase your monthly cash\n",
      "flow from the asset column to the point that it exceeds your monthly\n",
      "expenses. Once you accomplish this, you are able to get out of the Rat Race\n",
      "and out onto the Fast Track.\n",
      "You can play CASHFLOW Classic on the web at\n",
      "www.richdad.com and learn how money works.\n",
      "As I have said, some people hate the game, some love it, and others\n",
      "miss the point. This woman missed a valuable opportunity to learn\n",
      "something. In the opening round, she drew a “doodad” card with the boat\n",
      "on it. At first she was happy. “Oh, I’ve got a boat.” Then, as her friend tried\n",
      "to explain how the numbers worked on her income statement and balance\n",
      "sheet, she got frustrated because she had never liked math. The rest of her\n",
      "table waited while her friend continued explaining the relationship between\n",
      "the income statement, balance sheet, and monthly cash flow. Suddenly,\n",
      "when she realized how the numbers worked, it dawned on her that her boat\n",
      "was eating her alive. Later on in the game, she was also downsized and had\n",
      "a child. It was a horrible game for her.\n",
      "After the class, her friend came by and told me that she was upset. She\n",
      "had come to the class to learn about investing and did not like the idea that\n",
      "it took so long to play a silly game.\n",
      "Her friend attempted to tell her to look within herself to see if the game\n",
      "reflected her in any way. With that suggestion, the woman demanded her\n",
      "money back. She said that the very idea that a game could be a reflection of\n",
      "her was ridiculous. Her money was promptly refunded, and she left.\n",
      "Since 1984, I have made millions simply by doing what the school\n",
      "system does not do. In school, most teachers lecture. I hated lectures as a\n",
      "student. I was soon bored, and my mind would drift.\n",
      "In 1984, I began teaching via games and simulations, and I still rely on\n",
      "these tools today. I always encourage adult students to look at games as\n",
      "reflecting back to them what they know and what they need to learn. Most\n",
      "importantly, games reflect behavior. They are instant feedback systems.\n",

      "The friend of the woman who left later called to give me an update. She\n",
      "said her friend was fine and had calmed down. In her cooling-off period,\n",
      "she could see some slight relationship between the game and her life.\n",
      "Although she and her husband did not own a boat, they did own everything\n",
      "else imaginable. She was angry after their divorce, both because he had run\n",
      "off with a younger woman and because, after twenty years of marriage, they\n",
      "had accumulated little in the way of assets. There was virtually nothing for\n",
      "them to split. Their twenty years of married life had been incredible fun, but\n",

      "Games reflect behavior. They are instant feedback systems.\n",
      "She realized that her anger at doing the numbers—the income statement\n",
      "and balance sheet—came from her embarrassment about not understanding\n",

      "—the option most people subscribe to. The problem is this: It blinds the\n",
      "person to what is really going on. It causes them to miss major\n",
      "opportunities for much more significant growth of their money. The world\n",
      "is passing them by.\n",
      "As I said, the economy was terrible at that time. For investors, this is the\n",
      "perfect market condition. A chunk of my money was in the stock market\n",
      "and in apartment houses. I was short of cash. Because people were giving\n",
      "properties away, I was buying. I was not saving money. I was investing.\n",
      "Kim and I had more than a million dollars in cash working in a market that\n",
      "was rising fast. It was the best opportunity to invest. The economy was\n",
      "terrible. I just could not pass up these small deals.\n",
      "Houses that were once $100,000 were now $75,000. But instead of\n",

      "attorney’s office, or the courthouse steps. In these shopping places, a\n",

      "attorney a cashier’s check as a down payment. While the acquisition was\n",
      "being processed, I ran an ad advertising a $75,000 house for only $60,000\n",
      "and no money down. The phone rang hard and heavy. Prospective buyers\n",
      "were screened and once the property was legally mine, all the prospective\n",
      "buyers were allowed to look at the house. It was a feeding frenzy. The\n",

      "from money in my asset column in the form of a promissory note from the\n",
      "buyer. Total working time: five hours.\n",

      "$190,000 in assets (notes at 10 percent interest) in those six “buy, create,\n",

      "much of it sheltered through our private corporation. Much of that $19,000\n",
      "a year goes to pay for our company cars, gas, trips, insurance, dinners with\n",
      "clients, and other things. By the time the government gets a chance to tax\n",
      "that income, it’s been spent on legally allowed pre-tax expenses.\n",
      "This was a simple example of how money is invented, created, and\n",
      "protected using financial intelligence.\n",
      "Ask yourself: How long would it take to save $190,000? Would the\n",
      "bank pay you 10 percent interest on your money? And the promissory note\n",
      "is good for 30 years. I hope they never pay me the $190,000. I have to pay a\n",
      "tax if they pay me the principal, and besides, $19,000 paid over 30 years is\n",
      "a little over $500,000 in income.\n",
      "I have people ask what happens if the person doesn’t pay. That does\n",
      "happen, and it’s good news. That $60,000 home could be taken back and re-\n",
      "sold for $70,000, and another $2,500 collected as a loan-processing fee. It\n",
      "would still be a zero-down transaction in the mind of the new buyer. And\n",
      "the process would go on.\n",
      "The first time I sold the house, I paid back the $2,000, so technically, I\n",
      "have no money in the transaction. My return on investment (ROI) is\n",
      "infinity. It’s an example of no money making a lot of money.\n",
      "In the second transaction, when re-sold, I would have put $2,000 in my\n",
      "pocket and re-extended the loan to 30 years. What would my ROI be if I got\n",
      "paid money to make money? I do not know, but it sure beats saving $100 a\n",
      "month, which actually starts out as $150 because it’s after-tax income for 40\n",
      "years earning low interest. And again, you’re taxed on the interest. That is\n",
      "not too intelligent. It may be safe, but it’s not smart.\n",
      "A few years later, as the Phoenix real estate market strengthened, those\n",
      "houses we sold for $60,000 became worth $110,000. Foreclosure\n",
      "opportunities were still available, but became rare. It cost a valuable asset,\n",
      "my time, to go out looking for them. Thousands of buyers were looking for\n",
      "the few available deals. The market had changed. It was time to move on\n",
      "and look for other opportunities to put in the asset column.\n",
      "“You can’t do that here.” “That is against the law.” “You’re lying.” I\n",
      "hear those comments much more often than “Can you show me how to do\n",
      "that?” The math is simple. You do not need algebra or calculus. And the\n",
      "escrow company handles the legal transaction and the servicing of the\n",
      "payments. I have no roofs to fix or toilets to unplug because the owners do\n",
      "that. It’s their house. Occasionally someone does not pay. And that is\n",
      "wonderful because there are late fees, or they move out and the property is\n",
      "sold again. The court system handles that.\n",
      "And it may not work in your area. The market conditions may be\n",
      "different. But the example illustrates how a simple financial process can\n",
      "create hundreds of thousands of dollars, with little money and low risk. It is\n",
      "an example of money being only an agreement. Anyone with a high school\n",
      "education can do it.\n",
      "Yet most people won’t. Most people listen to the standard advice of\n",
      "“Work hard and save money.”\n",
      "For about 30 hours of work, approximately $190,000 was created in the\n",
      "asset column, and no taxes were paid.\n",

      "1.\n",

      "There are two kinds of investors:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "The first and most common type is a person who buys a packaged\n",
      "investment. They call a retail outlet, such as a real estate company,\n",
      "a stockbroker, or a financial planner, and they buy something. It\n",
      "could be a mutual fund, a REIT, a stock or a bond. It is a clean and\n",
      "simple way of investing. An analogy would be a shopper who goes\n",
      "to a computer store and buys a computer right off the shelf.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "The second type is an investor who creates investments. This\n",
      "investor usually assembles a deal in the same way a person who\n",
      "buys components builds a computer. I do not know the first thing\n",
      "about putting components of a computer together, but I do know\n",
      "how to put pieces of opportunities together, or know people who\n",
      "know how.\n",
      "It is this second type of investor who is the more professional investor.\n",
      "Sometimes it may take years for all the pieces to come together. And\n",
      "sometimes they never do. It’s this second type of investor that my rich dad\n",
      "encouraged me to be. It is important to learn how to put the pieces together,\n",
      "because that is where the huge wins reside, and sometimes some huge\n",
      "losses if the tide goes against you.\n",
      "If you want to be the second type of investor, you need to develop three\n",
      "main skills.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Find an opportunity that everyone else missed.\n",
      "You see with your mind what others miss with their eyes. For\n",
      "example, a friend bought this rundown old house. It was spooky to\n",
      "look at. Everyone wondered why he bought it. What he saw that we\n",
      "did not was that the house came with four extra empty lots. He\n",
      "discovered that after going to the title company. After buying the\n",
      "house, he tore the house down and sold the five lots to a builder for\n",
      "three times what he paid for the entire package. He made $75,000\n",
      "for two months of work. It’s not a lot of money, but it sure beats\n",
      "minimum wage. And it’s not technically difficult.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Raise money.\n",
      "The average person only goes to the bank. This second type of\n",
      "investor needs to know how to raise capital, and there are many\n",
      "ways that don’t require a bank. To get started, I learned how to buy\n",
      "houses without a bank. It was the learned skill of raising money,\n",
      "more than the houses themselves, that was priceless.\n",
      "All too often I hear people say, “The bank won’t lend me money,”\n",
      "or “I don’t have the money to buy it.” If you want to be a type-two\n",
      "investor, you need to learn how to do that which stops most people.\n",
      "In other words, a majority of people let their lack of money stop\n",
      "them from making a deal. If you can avoid that obstacle, you will\n",
      "be millions ahead of those who don’t learn those skills. There have\n",
      "been many times I have bought a house, a stock, or an apartment\n",
      "building without a penny in the bank. I once bought an apartment\n",
      "house for $1.2 million. I did what is called “tying it up,” with a\n",
      "written contract between seller and buyer.\n",
      "I then raised the $100,000 deposit, which bought me 90 days to\n",
      "raise the rest of the money. Why did I do it? Simply because I knew\n",
      "it was worth $2 million. I never raised the money. Instead, the\n",
      "person who put up the $100,000 gave me $50,000 for finding the\n",
      "deal, took over my position, and I walked away. Total working\n",
      "time: three days. Again, it’s what you know more than what you\n",
      "buy. Investing is not buying. It’s more a case of knowing.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Organize smart people.\n",
      "Intelligent people are those who work with or hire a person who is\n",
      "more intelligent than they are. When you need advice, make sure\n",
      "you choose your advisor wisely.\n",
      "There is a lot to learn, but the rewards can be astronomical. If you do\n",
      "not want to learn those skills, then being a type-one investor is highly\n",
      "recommended. It is what you know that is your greatest wealth. It is what\n",

      "Personally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and the\n",

      "Today, I meet ex-schoolteachers earning hundreds of thousands of\n",

      "Both of my dads were generous men. Both made it a practice to give\n",

      "didn’t have to think anymore. “How can I afford it?” opened up the brain\n",
      "and forced it to think and search for answers.\n",
      "But most importantly, he felt the words, “I can’t afford it,” were a lie.\n",
      "And the human spirit knows it. “The human spirit is very, very powerful,”\n",
      "he would say. “It knows it can do anything.” By having a lazy mind that\n",
      "says, “I can’t afford it,” a war breaks out inside you. Your spirit is angry,\n",
      "and your lazy mind must defend its lie. The spirit is screaming, “Come on.\n",
      "Let’s go to the gym and work out.” And the lazy mind says, “But I’m tired.\n",
      "I worked really hard today.” Or the human spirit says, “I’m sick and tired of\n",
      "being poor. Let’s get out there and get rich.” To which the lazy mind says,\n",
      "“Rich people are greedy. Besides it’s too much bother. It’s not safe. I might\n",

      "work anyway. Look at what I have to do tonight. My boss wants it finished\n",
      "by morning.”\n",
      "“I can’t afford it” also causes sadness, a helplessness that leads to\n",
      "despondency and often depression. “How can I afford it?” opens up\n",
      "possibilities, excitement, and dreams. So rich dad was not so concerned\n",
      "about what we wanted to buy as long as we understood that “How can I\n",
      "afford it?” creates a stronger mind and a dynamic spirit.\n",
      "Thus he rarely gave Mike or me anything. He would instead ask, “How\n",
      "can you afford it?” and that included college, which we paid for ourselves.\n",
      "It was not the goal, but the process of attaining the goal that he wanted us to\n",
      "learn.\n",
      "The problem I see today is that there are millions of people who feel\n",

      "never be able to afford that.”\n",
      "When I decided to exit the Rat Race, it was simply a question of “How\n",
      "can I afford to never work again?” And my mind began to kick out answers\n",
      "and solutions. The hardest part was fighting my real parents’ dogma: “We\n",
      "can’t afford that.” “Stop thinking only about yourself.” “Why don’t you\n",
      "think about others?” and other similar sentiments designed to instill guilt to\n",
      "suppress my “greed.”\n",
      "So how do you beat laziness? Once again, the answer is a little greed.\n",
      "It’s that radio station WII-FM, which stands for “What’s In It For Me?” A\n",

      "yourself avoiding something you know you should be doing, then the only\n",
      "thing to ask yourself is, “What’s in it for me?” Be a little greedy. It’s the\n",
      "best cure for laziness.\n",
      "Too much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good.\n",
      "But just remember what Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street:\n",

      "“Yeah, I’ll bet he has to.”\n",
      "“Nah,” said the group cynic. “I’ll bet he was born that way. Besides,\n",
      "let’s stop talking about Arnold and get some beers.”\n",
      "This is an example of habits controlling behavior. I remember asking\n",
      "my rich dad about the habits of the rich. Instead of answering me outright,\n",
      "he wanted me to learn through example, as usual.\n",
      "“When does your dad pay his bills?” rich dad asked.\n",
      "“The first of the month,” I said.\n",
      "“Does he have anything left over?” he asked.\n",
      "“Very little,” I said.\n",
      "“That’s the main reason he struggles,” said rich dad. “He has bad habits.\n",
      "Your dad pays everyone else first. He pays himself last, but only if he has\n",
      "anything left over.”\n",
      "“Which he usually doesn’t,” I said. “But he has to pay his bills, doesn’t\n",
      "he? You’re saying he shouldn’t pay his bills?”\n",
      "“Of course not,” said rich dad. “I firmly believe in paying my bills on\n",

      "“But what happens if you don’t have enough money?” I asked. “What\n",
      "do you do then?”\n",
      "“The same,” said rich dad. “I still pay myself first. Even if I’m short of\n",
      "money. My asset column is far more important to me than the government.”\n",
      "“But,” I said. “Don’t they come after you?”\n",
      "“Yes, if you don’t pay,” said rich dad. “Look, I did not say not to pay. I\n",
      "just said I pay myself first, even if I’m short of money.”\n",
      "“But,” I replied. “How do you do that?”\n",
      "“It’s not how. The question is ‘Why?’” rich dad said.\n",
      "“Okay, why?”\n",
      "“Motivation,” said rich dad. “Who do you think will complain louder if\n",
      "I don’t pay them—me, or my creditors?”\n",
      "“Your creditors will definitely scream louder than you,” I said,\n",
      "responding to the obvious. “You wouldn’t say anything if you didn’t pay\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "“So you see, after paying myself, the pressure to pay my taxes and the\n",
      "other creditors is so great that it forces me to seek other forms of income.\n",
      "The pressure to pay becomes my motivation. I’ve worked extra jobs, started\n",
      "other companies, traded in the stock market, anything just to make sure\n",
      "those guys don’t start yelling at me. That pressure made me work harder,\n",
      "forced me to think, and all in all, made me smarter and more active when it\n",
      "comes to money. If I had paid myself last, I would have felt no pressure, but\n",
      "I’d be broke.”\n",
      "“So it is the fear of the government or other people you owe money to\n",
      "that motivates you?”\n",
      "“That’s right,” said rich dad. “You see, government bill collectors are\n",
      "big bullies. So are bill collectors in general. Most people give into these\n",
      "bullies. They pay them and never pay themselves. You know the story of\n",
      "the 98-pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face?”\n",
      "I nodded. “I see that ad for weightlifting and bodybuilding lessons in the\n",

      "“Well, most people let the bullies kick sand in their faces. I decided to\n",
      "use the fear of the bully to make me stronger. Others get weaker. Forcing\n",
      "myself to think about how to make extra money is like going to the gym\n",
      "and working out with weights. The more I work my mental money muscles\n",
      "out, the stronger I get. Now I’m not afraid of those bullies.”\n",
      "I liked what rich dad was saying. “So if I pay myself first, I get\n",
      "financially stronger, mentally and fiscally.”\n",
      "Rich dad nodded.\n",
      "“And if I pay myself last, or not at all, I get weaker. So people like\n",
      "bosses, managers, tax collectors, bill collectors, and landlords push me\n",
      "around all my life—just because I don’t have good money habits.”\n",

      "Overcoming Arrogance\n",
      "“What I know makes me money. What I don’t know loses me money.\n",
      "Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. Because when I’m\n",
      "arrogant, I truly believe that what I don’t know is not important,” rich dad\n",
      "would often tell me.\n",
      "I have found that many people use arrogance to try to hide their own\n",
      "ignorance. It often happens when I am discussing financial statements with\n",
      "accountants or even other investors.\n",

      "financial genius. I believe that each of us has a financial genius within us.\n",
      "The problem is that our financial genius lies asleep, waiting to be called\n",
      "upon. It lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that\n",

      "I once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming for the U.S.\n",

      "dear friends. I’ve noticed that my friends with money talk about money.\n",
      "They don’t do it to brag. They’re interested in the subject. So I learn from\n",

      "Being stuck in the Rat Race is not intelligent.\n",

      "do not have to be. I’d rather play golf.\n",

      "much. Why would I want to save a few bucks when I could use that time to\n",

      "Keep in mind that not all brokers are created equal. Unfortunately, most\n",
      "brokers are only salespeople. They sell, but they themselves own little or no\n",
      "real estate. There is a tremendous difference between a broker who sells\n",
      "houses and a broker who sells investments. The same is true for stock,\n",
      "bond, mutual fund, and insurance, brokers who call themselves financial\n",
      "planners.\n",
      "When I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much\n",
      "property or stocks they personally own and what percentage they pay in\n",
      "taxes. And that applies to my tax attorney as well as my accountant. I have\n",
      "an accountant who minds his own business. His profession is accounting,\n",
      "but his business is real estate. I used to have an accountant who was a\n",

      "settler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. Mistaking it for\n",
      "a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back.\n",
      "The Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not want\n",
      "to give it back. That is where the term “Indian giver” came from, a simple\n",
      "cultural misunderstanding.\n",
      "In the world of the asset column, being an Indian giver is vital to\n",
      "wealth. The sophisticated investor’s first question is: “How fast do I get my\n",
      "money back?” They also want to know what they get for free, also called a\n",
      "“piece of the action.” That is why the ROI, or return on investment, is so\n",
      "important.\n",
      "For example, I found a small condominium that was in foreclosure a\n",
      "few blocks from where I lived. The bank wanted $60,000, and I submitted a\n",
      "bid for $50,000, which they took, simply because, along with my bid, was a\n",
      "cashier’s check for $50,000. They realized I was serious. Most investors\n",
      "would say, “Aren’t you tying up a lot of cash? Would it not be better to get\n",
      "a loan on it?” The answer is, “Not in this case.” My investment company\n",
      "uses this condominium as a vacation rental in the winter months when the\n",
      "“snowbirds” come to Arizona. It rents for $2,500 a month for four months\n",
      "out of the year. For rental during the off-season, it rents for only $1,000 a\n",
      "month. I had my money back in about three years. Now I own this asset,\n",
      "which pumps money out for me, month in and month out.\n",
      "The sophisticated investor’s first question is: “How fast do I get\n",
      "my money back?”\n",
      "The same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker calls and\n",
      "recommends I move a sizable amount of money into the stock of a company\n",
      "that he feels is just about to make a move that will add value to the stock,\n",
      "like announcing a new product. I will move my money in for a week to a\n",
      "month while the stock moves up. Then I pull my initial dollar amount out,\n",
      "and stop worrying about the fluctuations of the market, because my initial\n",
      "money is back and ready to work on another asset. So my money goes in,\n",
      "and then it comes out, and I own an asset that was technically free.\n",
      "True, I have lost money on many occasions, but I only play with money\n",
      "I can afford to lose. I would say, on an average 10 investments, I hit home\n",
      "runs on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I lose on two or\n",
      "three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in at that time.\n",
      "People who hate risk put their money in the bank. In the long run, safe\n",
      "savings are better than no savings. But it takes a long time to get your\n",
      "money back and, in most instances, you don’t get anything for free with it.\n",
      "On every one of my investments, there must be an upside, something\n",
      "for free—like a condominium, a mini-storage, a piece of free land, a house,\n",
      "stock shares, or an office building. And there must be limited risk, or a low-\n",
      "risk idea. There are books devoted entirely to this subject, so I will not talk\n",
      "about it here. Ray Kroc, of McDonald’s fame, sold hamburger franchises,\n",
      "not because he loved hamburgers, but because he wanted the real estate\n",
      "under the franchise for free.\n",
      "So wise investors must look at more than ROI. They look at the assets\n",
      "they get for free once they get their money back. That is financial\n",

      "A friend’s child has been developing a nasty habit of burning a hole in\n",
      "his pocket. Just 16, he wanted his own car. The excuse: “All his friends’\n",

      "of us have been asked.\n",
      "I had many interests as a kid, and it was easy to choose. If it sounded\n",
      "exciting and glamorous, I wanted to do it. I wanted to be a marine biologist,\n",
      "an astronaut, a Marine, a ship’s officer, a pilot, and a professional football\n",
      "player.\n",
      "I was fortunate enough to achieve three of those goals: a Marine Corps\n",
      "officer, a ship’s officer, and a pilot.\n",
      "I knew I did not want to become a teacher, a writer, or an accountant. I\n",
      "did not want to be a teacher because I did not like school. I did not want to\n",
      "be a writer because I failed English twice. And I dropped out of my MBA\n",
      "program because I could not stand accounting.\n",
      "Ironically, now that I have grown up, I have become everything I never\n",
      "wanted to become. Although I disliked school, today I own an education\n",
      "company. I personally teach around the world because I love teaching.\n",
      "Although I failed English twice because I could not write, today I am best\n",
      "known as an author. My book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, was on the New York\n",
      "Times best-sellers list for over seven years and is one of the top three best-\n",
      "selling books in the United States. The only books ahead of it are The Joy of\n",
      "Sex and The Road Less Traveled. Adding one more irony, Rich Dad Poor\n",
      "Dad and my CASHFLOW® board game are a book and a game about\n",
      "accounting, another subject I struggled with.\n",
      "So what does this have to do with the question: “What is your goal in\n",
      "life?”\n",
      "The answer is found in the simple, yet profound, statement by a\n",
      "Vietnamese monk, Thich Naht Hahn: “The path is the goal.” In other words,\n",
      "finding your path in life is your goal in life. Your path is not your\n",
      "profession, how much money you make, your title, or your successes and\n",
      "failures.\n",
      "Finding your path means finding out what you were put here on this\n",
      "earth to do. What is your life’s purpose? Why were you given this gift\n",
      "called life? And what is the gift you give back to life?\n",
      "Looking back, I know going to school was not about finding my life’s\n",
      "path. I spent four years in military school, studying and training to be a\n",
      "ship’s officer. If I had made a career sailing for Standard Oil on their oil\n",
      "tankers, I would never have found my life’s path. If I had stayed in the\n",
      "Marines or had gone to fly for the airlines, I would never have found my\n",
      "life’s path.\n",
      "Had I continued on as a ship’s officer or become an airline pilot, I\n",
      "would never have become an international best-selling author, been a guest\n",

      "investing throughout the world.\n",
      "Finding Your Path\n",
      "This CASHFLOW Quadrant book is important because it is about\n",
      "finding your path in life. As you know, most people are programmed early\n",

      "or S quadrant. It is not about finding your life’s path.\n",
      "I realize there are people who know exactly what they are going to do\n",
      "early in life. They grow up knowing they are going to be a doctor, lawyer,\n",
      "musician, golfer or actor. We have all heard about child prodigies, kids with\n",
      "exceptional talents. Yet you may notice, these are professions, not\n",
      "necessarily a life’s path.\n",
      "So How Does One Find Their Path in Life?\n",
      "My answer is: I wish I knew. If I could wave my magic wand and your\n",
      "life’s path would magically appear, I would.\n",
      "Since I do not have a magic wand nor can I tell you what to do, the best\n",
      "thing I can do is tell you what I did. And what I did was trust my intuition,\n",
      "my heart, and my guts. For example, in 1973, returning from the war, when\n",
      "my poor dad suggested I go back to school, get my higher degrees, and\n",
      "work for the government, my brain went numb, my heart went heavy and\n",
      "my gut said, “No way.”\n",
      "When he suggested I get my old job back with Standard Oil or fly for\n",
      "the airlines, again my mind, heart, and gut said no. I knew I was through\n",
      "sailing and flying, although they were great professions and the pay was\n",
      "pretty good.\n",

      "Traditional education was a great environment for the “A” students, but\n",
      "it was not the environment for me. Traditional education was crushing my\n",

      "mentally and physically. As a Marine pilot, I was strong emotionally and\n",
      "spiritually, but all on the macho-male development side. I had no gentle\n",
      "side, no female energy. After all, I was trained to be Marine Corps officer,\n",

      "for grades, degrees, promotions, or credentials again. From then on, if I did\n",

      "Like the medals and ribbons on a Marine pilot’s chest, advanced degrees\n",
      "and brand-name schools were the status and the stripes that educators wore\n",

      "that seminar was over, I became a seminar junkie, going from seminar to\n",

      "The more I studied, the more curious about traditional education I\n",

      "Why are most schoolteachers poor?\n",

      "Why do schools teach us little about money?\n",
      "Those questions led me to become a student of education outside the\n",

      "understood why I did not like school and why schools failed to serve most\n",
      "of its students, even the “A” students.\n",
      "My curiosity touched my spirit, and I became an entrepreneur in\n",
      "education. If not for this curiosity, I might never have become an author and\n",

      "life, he went to law school after graduation, spending three more years\n",
      "becoming a lawyer and entering private practice in the S quadrant.\n",

      "family, kids, a mortgage, and bills to pay.\n",
      "A year before he died, I met him at a class reunion in New York. He\n",
      "was a bitter man. “All I do is sweep up behind rich guys like you. They pay\n",

      "He made a lot of money via his professional training, but he was\n",
      "emotionally angry, spiritually dead, and soon his body followed.\n",
      "I realize this is an extreme example. Most people do not hate what they\n",
      "do as much as my friend did. Yet it illustrates the problem when a person is\n",
      "trapped in a profession and unable to find their path.\n",

      "My Reason for Becoming a Teacher\n",
      "My primary reason for becoming a teacher in the B quadrant was a\n",
      "desire to provide financial education. I wanted to make this education\n",
      "available to anyone who wanted to learn, regardless of how much money\n",
      "they had or what their grade-point averages were. That is why The Rich\n",

      "have people teach people. There is no need for an expensive teacher or\n",
      "classroom. The CASHFLOW game is now translated into over sixteen\n",
      "languages, reaching millions of people all over the world.\n",
      "Today, The Rich Dad Company offers financial-education courses as\n",
      "well as the services of coaches and mentors to support a person’s financial\n",
      "education. Our programs are especially important for anyone wanting to\n",

      "There is no guarantee that everyone will make it to the B and I\n",
      "quadrants, yet they will know how to access those quadrants if they want to.\n",
      "Change Is Not Easy\n",
      "For me, changing quadrants was not easy. It was hard work mentally,\n",
      "but more so emotionally and spiritually. Growing up in a family of highly\n",
      "educated employees in the E quadrant, I carried their values of education,\n",
      "job security, benefits, and a government pension. In many ways, my family\n",
      "values made my transition difficult. I had to shut out their warnings,\n",
      "concerns, and criticisms about becoming an entrepreneur and investor.\n",
      "Some of their values I had to discount were:\n",
      "•\n",
      "“But you have to have a job.”\n",
      "•\n",
      "“You’re taking too many risks.”\n",
      "•\n",
      "“What if you fail?”\n",
      "•\n",
      "“Just go back to school and get your masters degree.”\n",

      "•\n",
      "“Play it safe. Don’t go for your dreams.”\n",
      "Diet and Exercise\n",
      "I mention emotional and spiritual development because that is what it\n",
      "takes to make a permanent change in life. For example, it rarely works to\n",
      "tell an overweight person, “Just eat less and exercise more.” Diet and\n",
      "exercise may make sense mentally, but most people who are overweight do\n",
      "not eat because they are hungry. They eat to feed an emptiness in their\n",
      "emotions and their soul. When a person goes on a diet-and-exercise\n",
      "program, they are only working on their mind and their body. Without\n",
      "emotional development and spiritual strength, the overweight person may\n",
      "go on a diet for six months and lose a ton of weight, only to put even more\n",
      "weight back on later.\n",
      "The same is true for changing quadrants. Saying to yourself, “I’m going\n",
      "to become an entrepreneur in the B quadrant,” is as futile as a chain smoker\n",
      "saying, “Tomorrow I’m going to quit smoking.” Smoking is a physical\n",
      "addiction caused by emotional and spiritual challenges. Without emotional\n",
      "and spiritual support, the smoker will always be a smoker. The same is true\n",

      "Why “A” Students Fail\n",
      "Looking at the diagram again, it is easy to see why so many “A”\n",
      "students fail in the world of money.\n",
      "A person may be highly educated mentally, but if they are not educated\n",
      "emotionally, their fear will often stop their body from doing what it must\n",
      "do. That is why so many “A” students get stuck in “analysis paralysis,”\n",
      "studying every little detail, but failing to do anything.\n",
      "This “analysis paralysis” is caused by our educational system punishing\n",
      "students for making mistakes. If you think about it, “A” students are “A”\n",
      "students simply because they made the fewest mistakes. The problem with\n",
      "that emotional psychosis is that, in the real world, people who take action\n",
      "are the ones who make the most mistakes and learn from them to win in the\n",
      "game of life.\n",
      "Just look at Presidents Clinton and Bush. Clinton could not admit he\n",
      "had sex and Bush could not recall any mistakes he made during his\n",
      "presidency. Making mistakes is human, but lying about your mistakes is\n",
      "criminal, a criminal act known as perjury.\n",
      "When criticized for making 1,014 mistakes before creating the electric\n",
      "light bulb, Thomas Edison said, “I did not fail 1,014 times. I successfully\n",
      "found out what did not work 1,014 times.”\n",
      "In other words, the reason so many people fail to achieve success is\n",
      "because they fail to fail enough times.\n",
      "Looking at the diagram again,\n",
      "one of the reasons so many people cling to job security is because they lack\n",
      "emotional education. They let fear stop them.\n",
      "One of the best things about military school and the Marine Corps is\n",
      "that these organizations spend a lot of time developing young men and\n",
      "women spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and physically. Although it was a\n",
      "tough education, it was a complete education, preparing us to do a nasty\n",
      "job.\n",
      "The reason I created the CASHFLOW game is because the game\n",
      "educates the whole person. The game is a better teaching tool than reading\n",
      "or lecture, simply because the game involves the body, mind, emotions, and\n",
      "spirit of the player.\n",
      "The game is designed for players to make as many mistakes as possible\n",
      "with play money, and then learn from those mistakes. To me, this is a more\n",
      "humane way to learn about money.\n",
      "The Path Is the Goal\n",
      "Today, there are thousands of CASHFLOW clubs all over the world.\n",
      "One reason why CASHFLOW clubs are important is because they are a\n",

      "CASHFLOW club, you get to meet people like you, people who are\n",
      "committed to making changes, not just talking about change.\n",
      "Unlike school, there is not a requirement of past academic success. All\n",
      "that is asked is a sincere desire to learn and make changes. In the game, you\n",
      "will make a lot of mistakes in different financial situations and will learn\n",
      "from your mistakes, using play money.\n",
      "CASHFLOW clubs are not for those who want to get rich quick.\n",
      "CASHFLOW clubs are there to support the long-term mental, emotional,\n",
      "spiritual, physical, and financial changes a person needs to go through. We\n",

      "a life path that looked like this:\n",
      "Poor dad recommended that I become either a well-paid E, employee, or\n",
      "a well-paid S, self-employed professional, such as a medical doctor, lawyer,\n",
      "or accountant. My poor dad was very concerned about a steady paycheck,\n",
      "benefits, and job security. That’s why he was a well-paid government\n",
      "official, the head of education for the State of Hawaii.\n",
      "Rich Dad’s Advice\n",
      "My uneducated, but rich, dad offered very different advice. He said,\n",
      "“Go to school, graduate, build businesses, and become a successful\n",
      "investor.” He was recommending a life path that looked like this:\n",
      "This book is about the mental, emotional, and educational process I\n",
      "went through in following my rich dad’s advice.\n",
      "Who Is This Book For?\n",
      "This book is written for people who are ready to change quadrants,\n",
      "especially for individuals who are currently in the E and S categories and\n",
      "are contemplating moving to the B or I category. This book is for people\n",
      "who are ready to move beyond job security and begin to achieve financial\n",
      "security. It’s not an easy life path, but the prize at the end of the road,\n",
      "financial freedom, is worth the journey.\n",
      "When I was 12 years old, rich dad told me a simple story that guided me\n",
      "to great wealth and financial freedom. It was his way of explaining the\n",
      "difference between the left side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant, the E and S\n",
      "quadrants, and the right side, or the B and I quadrants. The story goes like\n",
      "this:\n",
      "“Once upon a time there was this quaint little village. It was a great\n",
      "place to live except for one problem. The village had no water unless it\n",
      "rained. To solve this problem once and for all, the village elders asked\n",
      "contractors to submit bids to deliver water to the village on a daily basis.\n",
      "Two people volunteered to take on the task, and the elders awarded the\n",
      "contract to both of them. They felt that a little competition would keep\n",
      "prices low and ensure a backup supply of water.\n",
      "“The first person who won the contract, Ed, immediately ran out,\n",
      "bought two galvanized steel buckets and began running back and forth to\n",
      "the lake which was a mile away. He immediately began making money as\n",
      "he labored morning to dusk, hauling water from the lake with his two\n",
      "buckets. He would empty them into the large concrete holding tank the\n",
      "village had built. Each morning he had to get up before the rest of the\n",
      "village awoke to make sure there was enough water for the people. It was\n",
      "hard work, but he was very happy to be making money and for having one\n",
      "of the two exclusive contracts for this business.\n",
      "“The second winning contractor, Bill, disappeared for a while. He\n",
      "wasn’t seen for months, which made Ed very happy, since he had no\n",
      "competition.\n",
      "“Instead of buying two buckets to compete with Ed, Bill wrote a\n",
      "business plan, created a corporation, found four investors, employed a\n",
      "president to do the work, and returned six months later with a construction\n",
      "crew. Within a year, his team had built a large-volume stainless-steel\n",
      "pipeline which connected the village to the lake.\n",
      "“At the grand-opening celebration, Bill announced that his water was\n",
      "cleaner than Ed’s water. Bill knew that the villagers had complained about\n",
      "the water’s lack of cleanliness. Bill also announced that he could supply the\n",
      "village with water 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Ed could only deliver\n",
      "water on weekdays because he didn’t want to work on weekends. Then Bill\n",
      "announced that he would charge 75 percent less than Ed did for this higher-\n",
      "quality, more-reliable water. The villagers cheered and immediately ran for\n",
      "the faucet at the end of Bill’s pipeline.\n",
      "“In order to compete, Ed immediately lowered his rates by 75 percent,\n",
      "bought two more buckets, added covers to his buckets and began hauling\n",
      "four buckets each trip. In order to provide better service, he hired his two\n",
      "sons to give him a hand on the night shift and on weekends. When his boys\n",
      "went off to college, he said to them, ‘Hurry back because someday this\n",
      "business will belong to you.’\n",
      "“For some reason, his two sons never returned. Eventually, Ed had\n",
      "employees and union problems. The union demanded higher wages and\n",
      "better benefits and wanted its members to only haul one bucket at a time.\n",
      "“Meanwhile, Bill realized that if this village needed water, then other\n",
      "villages must need water too. He rewrote his business plan and went off to\n",
      "sell his high-speed, high-volume, low-cost, clean-water delivery system to\n",
      "villages throughout the world. He only makes a penny per bucket of water\n",
      "delivered, but he delivers billions of buckets of water every day. Whether he\n",
      "works or not, billions of people consume billions of buckets of water, and\n",
      "all that money pours into his bank account. Bill developed a pipeline to\n",
      "deliver money to himself, as well as water to the villages.\n",
      "“Bill lived happily ever after. Ed worked hard for the rest of his life and\n",
      "had financial problems forever after. The end.”\n",
      "That story about Bill and Ed has guided me for years. It has assisted me\n",
      "in my life’s decision-making process. I often ask myself:\n",
      "“Am I building a pipeline or hauling buckets?”\n",
      "“Am I working hard, or am I working smart?”\n",
      "And the answers to those questions have made me financially free.\n",
      "That is what this book is about. It’s about what it takes to become a B\n",
      "and an I. It’s for people who are tired of hauling buckets and are ready to\n",
      "build pipelines for cash to flow into their pockets.\n",
      "This Book Is Divided into Three Parts\n",
      "Part One The first part of this book focuses on the core differences\n",
      "between people in the four quadrants. It shows why certain people gravitate\n",
      "to certain quadrants and often get stuck there without realizing it. It will\n",
      "help you identify where you are today in the quadrant and where you want\n",
      "to be in five years.\n",
      "Part Two The second part of this book is about personal change. It’s more\n",
      "about who you have to be, instead of what you have to do.\n",
      "Part Three The third part of this book explains how to find success on the\n",
      "right side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant. I will share more of my rich dad’s\n",
      "secrets on the skills required to be a successful B and I. It will help you\n",
      "choose your own path to financial freedom.\n",
      "Throughout Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant, I continue to stress the\n",
      "importance of financial intelligence. If you want to operate on the right\n",
      "side, the B- and I-quadrant side, you must be smarter than if you choose to\n",
      "stay on the left side, the E- and S-quadrant side. To be a B or I, you must be\n",
      "able to control the direction of your cash flow.\n",
      "This book is written for people who are ready to make changes in their\n",
      "lives to move beyond job security and begin to build their own pipelines to\n",
      "achieve financial freedom.\n",
      "We are in the Information Age which offers more opportunities for\n",
      "financial reward than ever before. Individuals with the skills of the B’s and\n",
      "I’s will be able to identify and seize those opportunities. To be successful in\n",
      "the Information Age, a person needs information from all four quadrants.\n",
      "Unfortunately, our schools are still in the Industrial Age and still prepare\n",
      "students for only the left side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant.\n",
      "If you’re looking for new answers to move forward in the Information\n",
      "Age, this book is for you. It doesn’t have all the answers, but it will share\n",
      "the deep personal and guiding insights I gained as I traveled from the E and\n",
      "S side to the B and I side.\n",
